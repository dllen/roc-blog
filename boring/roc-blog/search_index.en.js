代码解读"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/a-tc-commond-intro/":{"body":"本文将详细解析一行复杂的 tc (Traffic Control) 命令。这行命令通常用于混沌工程（Chaos Engineering）或网络模拟测试中，目的是在不影响其他流量的情况下，精准地对特定数据包施加延迟。\n命令全貌\n为了方便理解，我们先将这行命令还原为标准的 Shell 脚本格式（假设设备为 eth0，延迟为 100ms，标记为 123）：\n在 Go 语言项目中，它通常以字符串格式化的形式出现：\n核心目标\n这组命令的核心目标是：在指定的网络设备（如 eth0）上，仅对携带特定防火墙标记（fwmark）的数据包施加延迟，而让其他数据包保持原有的转发速度。\n它利用 iptables 打标和 tc 分流的配合来实现这一精确控制。\n命令拆解分析\n这行长命令实际上是由三个独立的 tc 子命令通过 &amp;&amp; 连接而成的。我们逐一拆解：\n1. 建立分流枢纽：prio 调度器\ntc qdisc add: 添加一个队列规则（Queueing Discipline）。\ndev %s: 指定操作的网卡设备。\nroot: 挂载到根节点，接管该设备的所有出口流量。\nhandle 1:0: 给这个规则分配句柄 ID 1:0。\nprio bands 4: 使用 prio（优先级）调度器，并创建 4 个频道（bands，编号 0-3）。\n作用：在网卡出口建立一个拥有 4 条车道的“交通枢纽”。默认情况下，流量会根据优先级进入不同的车道，但我们稍后会强制指定某些流量的去向。\n2. 制造拥堵路段：netem 延迟队列\nparent 1:4: 关键点！将新规则挂载到刚才 prio 调度器的第 4 个频道（Band 3，ID 为 1:4）上。\nnetem delay %sms: 使用 netem（网络模拟器）规则，增加 %s 毫秒的延迟。\n作用：将第 4 条车道改造成“拥堵路段”。任何进入这条车道的数据包，都必须等待指定时间才能通过。\n3. 设置交通警察：filter 过滤器\nparent 1:0: 过滤器挂载在主枢纽 1:0 上。\nprotocol ip: 仅处理 IP 协议包。\nhandle %s fw: 匹配规则。fw 代表根据防火墙标记（Firewall Mark）匹配，%s 是具体的标记值（如 123）。\nflowid 1:4: 动作。匹配中的数据包被强制导向 ID 为 1:4 的队列（即我们的延迟队列）。\n作用：在枢纽入口设置“交警”。交警检查数据包的标记，如果发现标记匹配，就强制指挥该数据包走第 4 条“拥堵车道”。\n完整工作流\n要让这套机制生效，还需要 iptables 的配合。\n打标 (iptables):\n在数据包离开机器前，用 iptables 给特定流量打上标记。例如，给发往 80 端口的 TCP 包打上标记 123：\n分流 (tc):\n普通流量：没有标记 123，经过 prio 调度器时，按默认策略（通常走 Band 1 或 Band 2），无额外延迟。\n目标流量：带有标记 123，被过滤器捕获，强制送入 Band 3 (1:4)，经过 netem 增加延迟，实现慢速传输。\n潜在风险与副作用\n这是一个经常被忽视但至关重要的问题：这组命令会影响其他未被标记的流量吗？\n答案是肯定的。\n当你执行 tc qdisc add dev eth0 root ... 时，你替换了网卡默认的队列调度器（通常是 fq_codel 或 pfifo_fast）。\n默认调度器 (fq_codel)：非常智能，能保证不同连接间的公平性，有效抑制缓冲区膨胀。\n当前调度器 (prio)：简单的优先级调度。\n后果：\n未被标记的普通流量虽然不会经过延迟队列，但它们现在由 prio 调度器管理。这意味着它们失去了 fq_codel 提供的公平性保障。在高负载下，某些流量可能会“饿死”其他流量，或者整体网络抖动变大。\n结论：此方案非常适合测试环境或故障模拟，但在生产环境长期运行时需谨慎评估对整体网络模型的影响。\n进阶探讨：关于 Bands 数量的选择\n疑问：如果我们将 bands 4 改为 bands 64，是否能获得更精细的控制？\n回答：技术上可行，但通常没有必要，甚至会增加维护成本。\n简单来说，你会成功创建一个拥有 64 个优先级队列的调度器，但默认情况下，其中绝大多数队列将是空的，不会被系统自动使用。\n1. 技术原理\nprio 调度器根据数据包的优先级将其分类到不同的 band 中。默认情况下，这个“优先级”来自于 IP 头中的 TOS (Type of Service) 字段。\nLinux 内核内置的 priomap 映射表非常简单，它只有效地使用了少数几个 band（通常是 Band 0, 1, 2）。\n2. 实际行为\nTOS 值 (含义)对应的 Band (索引)\n0x10 (最小延迟, SSH)1\n0x08 (最大吞吐, FTP)2\n0x00 (普通服务, HTTP)2\n结论：\n绝大多数普通流量（TOS 为 0）都会自动进入 Band 2。\n如果你创建了 64 个 band，Band 3 到 Band 63 将会是完全空的，除非你手动为每一个 band 添加过滤器规则。\n3. 为什么不推荐 Bands 64？\n资源浪费：创建大量未使用的队列。\n配置复杂：要想利用这些队列，你需要维护海量的 tc filter 规则。\n替代方案：在需要复杂 QoS 的场景下（如 ISP 或数据中心），通常会使用更高级的 HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket) 调度器，而不是简单的 prio。\n对于本文的目标——隔离特定流量——使用默认的 bands 3 或 bands 4 已经绰绰有余：\nBand 0-2: 处理系统默认流量。\nBand 3: 专用作延迟队列。\n清理与还原\n测试完成后，务必清理规则，恢复网络原状。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/a-tc-commond-intro/","title":"Linux TC

Protocol）混淆。本文将结合官方文档与实战经验，带你彻底搞懂 Agent Skill 的本质、使用方法、背后的设计哲学以及它与 MCP 的根本区别。\n1. Agent Skill 的本质是什么？\n简单来说，Agent Skill 是一个包含指令的 Markdown 文件，它教会 Claude 如何完成特定的任务。\n如果把 AI 比作一个新入职的员工：\nPrompt 是你临时的一句话命令。\nMemory 是他的记事本。\nMCP 是你给他配的电脑、数据库权限和 API 工具。\nSkill 则是你发给他的员工手册或SOP（标准作业程序）。\nSkill 赋予了 AI “专业知识”和“流程规范”。它不是工具本身，而是关于如何使用工具以及遵循什么标准的知识。\n例如，你可以创建一个 Skill 来教 Claude：\n按照团队特定的代码规范审查 Pull Request。\n生成符合公司格式的 Git Commit Message。\n查询数据库时优先使用特定的优化 SQL 模式。\n使用 Python 脚本生成符合 Slack 限制的 GIF 动图。\n本质上，Skill 是结构化的上下文注入。\n2. Agent Skill 的使用方法\n使用 Skill 非常简单，核心在于创建一个 SKILL.md 文件。\n2.1 文件结构\n一个最简单的 Skill 只需要一个文件夹和一个 SKILL.md 文件：\nSKILL.md 由两部分组成：\nYAML Frontmatter：元数据，告诉 Claude 这个技能叫什么，什么时候用。\nMarkdown 内容：具体的指令和示例。\n2.2 编写示例\n2.3 存放位置\nClaude 会根据存放位置决定 Skill 的生效范围：\n位置路径适用范围\n项目级.claude/skills/仅当前项目可用，适合项目特定的规范\n个人级~/.claude/skills/跨项目可用，适合个人的工作流偏好\n企业级(托管配置)组织内所有成员可用\n2.4 自动触发\n你不需要显式调用 Skill（如 /review-code）。当你的 Prompt 意图与 Skill 的 description 匹配时，Claude 会自动加载并应用该 Skill。\n2.5 实战演示：构建“SVG 图标生成助手”\n让我们构建一个更实用的 Skill，教 Claude 如何生成风格统一的 SVG 图标。这个例子展示了 Skill 如何结合外部文件来增强能力。\n目录结构：\n文件内容 (SKILL.md)：\n通过这个结构，Claude 不仅学会了“怎么画”，还学会了“用什么颜色画”，确保了输出的一致性。\n3. 渐进式披露机制 (Progressive Disclosure)\n这是 Agent Skill 设计中最精妙的地方。\n你可能会担心：“如果我定义了 100 个 Skills，每次对话都把它们全部塞进 Context，Token 不就爆炸了吗？”\n答案是不会。Agent Skills 使用了一种**渐进式披露（Progressive Disclosure）**机制。\n机制流程\n扫描与索引：在会话开始时，Claude 仅读取所有可用 Skills 的 YAML Frontmatter（主要是 name 和 description）。这只占用极少的 Token。\n意图匹配：当你发出指令（例如“帮我生成个 GIF”）时，Claude 根据 description 判断哪个 Skill 相关。\n按需加载：一旦命中某个 Skill，Claude 才会读取该 Skill 的 SKILL.md 完整内容（指令、步骤、示例）。\n延迟加载支持文件：如果 Skill 非常复杂，包含大量的文档或脚本，你可以将它们放在单独的文件中，并在 SKILL.md 中引用。Claude 只有在真正需要阅读细节时，才会去读取这些支持文件。\n价值：\nToken 效率极高：你可以拥有成百上千个 Skills，但只会消耗命中技能的 Token。\n专注度：避免无关的指令干扰 AI 的注意力。\n4. Agent Skill vs MCP：到底选哪个？\n这是开发者最容易困惑的问题。两者看似都扩展了 AI 的能力，但侧重点完全不同。\n维度Agent SkillMCP (Model Context Protocol)\n核心定义Knowledge (知识/流程)Tool / Capability (工具/能力)\n作用教 AI “如何做” (How to do)给 AI “用什么” (What to use)\n实现方式Markdown 文件 (文本指令)Server/Client 协议 (代码/API)\n依赖环境依赖现有的计算环境 (如本地 Shell, Python)依赖外部服务的连接 (如 Postgres, Slack API)\n典型场景代码规范、最佳实践、复杂任务的SOP读取数据库、访问文件系统、调用 SaaS API\n决策指南\n选择 MCP，如果：\n你需要让 AI 连接到一个外部系统（如数据库、Jira、GitHub、Slack）。\n你需要执行 AI 无法通过写代码直接完成的操作（如读取私有云日志）。\n你在构建通用的工具能力。\n选择 Skill，如果：\n你想规范 AI 的输出格式（如特定的 Commit 格式）。\n你想固化某种工作流（如“发布前的检查清单”）。\n你想让 AI 学会使用现有的工具（例如，你已经装了 ffmpeg，写一个 Skill 教 AI 如何组合参数来处理视频）。\n你需要复用一组复杂的 Prompt 提示词。\n协同工作\n最强大的模式是 Skill + MCP 结合使用：\nMCP 提供“查询数据库”的能力。\nSkill 提供“查询数据库时必须遵循的表结构规范和安全准则”。\n总结\nAgent Skill 是 AI 时代的“岗位培训手册”。它利用渐进式披露机制，以极低的成本赋予了 AI 专业的领域知识和流程规范。\n与 MCP 提供的“硬连接”能力不同，Skill 专注于“软实力”——即如何正确、优雅地使用工具。对于希望构建高质量、标准化 AI 辅助工作流的开发者来说，掌握 Agent Skill 的编写是必修课。\n参考资料：\nClaude Code Docs: Agent Skills\nSimon Willison: Claude Skills are

fencing token）。\n锁只是建议（advisory），业务层仍需幂等与回滚保障。\n赋予锁“租约”（lease/TTL）并持续续约；结合会话（session）与心跳释放过期锁。\n引入 fencing token（单调递增版本号）防止旧持有者在失效后仍然操作资源。\n评估维度\n正确性与一致性：是否线性一致、是否能防止“双主/脑裂”。\n可用性与容灾：跨机房、网络抖动、故障恢复能力。\n公平性：是否支持排队、公平获取（FIFO）。\n性能与成本：吞吐、延迟、存储/运维代价。\n易用性：API成熟度、客户端生态、部署复杂度。\nRedis 分布式锁\n基本模式：SET key value NX PX ttl 获取，释放用 Lua 保证原子性：\n续约：定期延长 TTL，避免长 GC/Stop-The-World导致过期；需守护线程。\nRedlock：通过多主实例多数派获取锁，但在强严格一致性语义上存在争议；不建议用于需要线性一致的关键场景。\n适用场景：同机房内的“去重/防重复任务启动”、非关键资源短持锁；配合幂等和回滚机制。\n风险与缓解：\n网络分区与主从切换可能导致锁可见性不一致；避免跨机房关键路径。\nTTL不是严格终止条件，过期后旧持有者仍可能继续操作；加 fencing token 在资源侧校验。\nZooKeeper 分布式锁\n核心机制：临时节点（ephemeral）+ 顺序节点（sequential）。创建 /${lock}/lock- 顺序临时节点；序号最小者获锁，其余监听前驱节点删除后再竞争。\n特性：强一致（基于 Zab），具备公平性（排队），会话失效自动释放。\n客户端：推荐使用 Curator Recipes（InterProcessMutex 等），处理好 Watch 一次性触发与重入。\n适用场景：需要强一致与公平的分布式协调（调度器、主选举、全局限流）。\n风险与缓解：\n群聚效应（herd effect）：尽量只监听前驱而非根目录，避免大量节点同时唤醒。\n会话过期与网络抖动：务必实现重连与锁重获逻辑。\netcd 分布式锁\n推荐模式：lease + Txn(CAS)。\n特性：线性一致（Raft），原生支持 lock API 与租约续约；可用 revision/mod_revision 作为 fencing token。\n适用场景：对一致性要求高的核心路径（支付、订单、分布式调度）。\n风险与缓解：\n网络分区与领导者选举：设计重试与指数退避，降级为读一致或只读模式。\n续约失败处理：监控 keepalive 延迟与失败率，及时释放与重获。\n数据库分布式锁\n模式一：行级锁/状态行 + 唯一约束 + CAS：\n模式二：PostgreSQL Advisory Lock：SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(hashtext(:resource));\n模式三：MySQL GET_LOCK('res', timeout) 与 RELEASE_LOCK('res')（注意复制一致性与可靠性）。\n特性：易用、无需新组件；但公平性与 TTL 支持有限，跨机房一致性取决于复制架构。\n适用场景：单库/同机房、任务编排/批处理；或过渡方案。\n风险与缓解：\n会话崩溃释放语义不一致（不同数据库实现差异）；建议显式心跳与过期字段。\n复制延迟（主从）可能导致锁可见性问题；关键路径谨慎使用。\n关键实践：Fencing Token\n原理：每次成功获取锁生成单调递增的令牌（版本号）。资源侧仅接受令牌更大的写入，防止“旧持有者”在锁过期/网络分区后继续写。\n示例：将 version/revision随写入一起校验；存储系统需具备原子比较能力（CAS/upsert）。\n场景最佳方案\n强一致、关键业务（支付/订单/配置变更）：优先 etcd/ZooKeeper + 租约续约 + fencing token。\n公平排队（调度/限流/分布式队列）：ZooKeeper 顺序节点或 etcd 的队列/锁实现。\n低一致性需求、短持锁（去重、定时任务防并发）：Redis SET NX PX + Lua 释放 + 续约守护；在单机房内使用。\n单库内任务编排/过渡期：数据库行级锁/Advisory Lock，但避免跨机房关键路径。\n监控与稳定性\n监控：锁等待时长、失败率、租约续约延迟、会话过期次数、fencing token 单调性、网络分区事件。\n降级：锁获取超时触发熔断或改为幂等重试；批任务降速；业务侧容错与回滚。\n常见坑\n仅依赖 TTL 作为安全阀门；旧持有者仍可能继续写 =&gt; 用 fencing token。\n忽视幂等与回滚；锁不是万能防线。\n未处理客户端重连与会话过期；需自动重试与锁重获。\nZK 监听根目录导致群聚效应；只监听前驱节点。\nRedis 跨机房使用 Redlock 期望强一致；不现实。\n示例速览\nRedis 获取与释放（Lua）：见上文；确保 value 是唯一持有者标识并在释放时核验。\netcd 事务：If(key missing) Then Put(key, lease)；用 revision 作为 fencing。\nPostgreSQL Advisory Lock：pg_try_advisory_lock + 会话结束自动释放；非线性一致全局锁。\n参考资料\n《数据密集型应用》：一致性、锁、Fencing Token 与分布式系统实践。\n官方文档：\nRedis SET NX/PX 与 Lua 原子释放\nZooKeeper

主机和外部世界之间的通信。支持几种不同的网络类型，支持不同的使用场景。\nDocker网络类型\n通过网络配置容器可以与其他容器和外部服务进行通信。\n容器必须连接到 Docker 网络才能接收任何网络连接。\n容器可用的通信路由取决于它的网络配置。\nDocker 带有[五个内置的网络驱动程序](Networking overview | Docker Docs)，它们实现了核心的网络功能:\nbridge\nhost\noverlay\nipvlan\nmacvlan\nbridge\n[bridge网络](Bridge network driver | Docker Docs)在主机和容器之间创建一个基于软件的桥接。\n连接到网络的容器可以相互通信，但是它们与网络外的容器是隔离的。\n网络中的每个容器都被分配了自己的 IP 地址。\n因为网络是桥接到主机的，所以容器也能够在局域网和因特网上进行通信。\n但是，它们不会以物理设备的形式出现在LAN上。\nhost\n使用[host网络](Host network driver | Docker Docs)的容器共享主机的网络堆栈，而没有任何隔离。\n它们没有分配自己的 IP 地址，端口绑定将直接发布到主机的网络接口。\n这意味着侦听端口80的容器进程将绑定到 &lt;host_ip&gt;:80。\noverlay\n[overlay网络](Overlay network driver | Docker Docs)是跨多个 Docker 主机的分布式网络。\n网络允许运行在任何主机上的所有容器彼此通信，而不需要 OS 级路由支持。\noverlay网络实现了[DockerSwarm](Swarm mode overview | Docker Docs)集群的网络，但是运行两个独立的 Docker Engine 实例时，两个实例的容器必须直接相互通信，也可以使用它们。\n这允许您构建自己的类似于 Swarm 的环境。\nipvlan\n[ipvlan](IPvlan network driver | Docker Docs) 是一个先进的驱动程序，提供了对分配给您的容器的 IPv4 和 IPv6地址的精确控制，以及第2层和第3层 VLAN 标记和路由。\n将容器化服务与现有物理网络集成时，此驱动程序非常有用。\nipvlan 网络被分配了它们自己的网络接口，这比基于桥接的网络提供了性能优势。\nmacvlan\n[macvlan](Macvlan network driver | Docker Docs) 是另一个高级选项，它允许容器以物理设备的形式出现在网络上。\n它的工作原理是为网络中的每个容器分配一个唯一的 MAC 地址。\n这种网络类型要求将主机的一个物理接口专用于虚拟网络。\n更广泛的网络还必须进行恰当的配置，以支持Docker主机创建的大量MAC地址。\n怎么选择使用那种网络类型？\nbridge网络，对于大多数场景是最合适的选择。网络中的容器可以使用它们自己的IP地址和DNS名称彼此通信。他们也可以访问主机的网络，所以他们可以达到互联网和局域网。\nhost网络，将服务端口直接绑定到主机接口并且不关心网络隔离时，host网络是最佳选择。这种网络模式允许容器化应用程序的服务像直接在主机上运行的网络服务。\noverlay网络，不同Docker主机上的容器需要彼此直接通信时，需要使用overlay网络。使用pverlay网络可以让你为高可用性建立自己的分布式环境。\nmacvlan，在容器必须作为主机网络上的物理设备出现的情况下，比如当容器运行监视网络流量的应用程序时，macvlan网络非常有用。\nipvlan网络，当对容器IP地址、标签和路由有特定要求时，ipvlan网络是一种高级选择。\nDocker还支持[第三方网络插件](Plugins and Services | Docker Docs)，这些插件使用其他操作模式扩展网络系统。其中包括使用 OpenStack Neutron实现网络的[Kuryr](GitHub - openstack/kuryr: Bridge between container framework networking and storage models to OpenStack networking and storage abstractions. Mirror of code maintained at opendev.org.)，以及着重于服务发现、安全和容错的覆盖网络 Weave。\nNOTE：Docker 网络在容器级别始终是可选的:\n容器的网络设置为none将完全禁用其网络堆栈。\n容器将无法与其他容器通信、主机的服务、互联网。\n这有助于通过沙箱化不需要连接的应用程序来提高安全性。\nDocker网络怎么工作的？\nDocker使用主机的网络栈来实现容器的网络系统。\n它通过配置[iptables](Packet filtering and firewalls | Docker Docs)规则将流量路由到容器来工作。\n这也提供了Docker网络和主机之间的隔离。\n[iptables](iptables(8) - Linux man page) 是标准的Linux包过滤工具。添加到iptables规则定义流量通过主机网络栈时如何路由。Docker 网络添加过滤规则，将匹配的流量指向容器的应用程序。规则是自动配置的，所以不需要手动配置iptables。\nDocker容器被分配它们自己的**[网络命名空间](network_namespaces(7) - Linux manual page)**，这是一个 Linux 内核特性，它提供了独立的虚拟网络环境。\n容器还在主机上创建虚拟网络接口，允许它们在其名称空间之外使用主机网络进行通信。\n实现Docker网络的细节是非常复杂，需要了解许多操作系统内核。\nDocker将它们从最终用户抽象出来，提供 简单、易用、可靠 容器网络配置流程。\n在[Docker的文档中](Packet filtering and firewalls | Docker Docs)可以查看更多信息。\nDocker网络与VM网络的区别\nDocker的网络模型为容器提供了隔离的虚拟环境。这些网络配置满足日常使用，但与传统虚拟机创建的虚拟网络相比，有一些关键的区别。\nDocker 使用 命名空间 和 iptables 规则实现网络隔离，而VM通常为每台虚拟机运行单独的网络堆栈。\n术语上的差异也可能导致混淆: Docker所称的“桥接”网络类似于大多数VM解决方案中基于[NAT](Network address translation - Wikipedia)的网络。\n通常，VM可以支持比Docker本身允许的范围更广的网络拓扑。然而，Docker 包含了创建所需网络解决方案的所有工具，无论是通过使用 macvlan 分配物理网络上的容器地址，还是通过使用第三方插件实现缺失的网络模型。\nDocker网络实验\n创建网络\n创建Docker网络，请使用 docker network create 命令，[文档](docker network create | Docker Docs)。\n可以通过设置-d 标志来指定要使用的驱动程序，例如host或bridge。\n如果省略该标志，则将创建bridge网络。\n执行以下命令：\n通过 docker network ls 和 docker network inspect demo-network 查看网络配置。新的网络配置目前没有用，因为没有容器被连接。\n连接容器和网络\n通过使用 docker run 命令设置 --network 标志，可以将新容器附加到网络。\n执行以下命令:\n现在尝试使用这两个容器的名称在它们之间进行通信:\n备注：如果通过 container name 不能被解析，可以手工添加hosts或者直接使用容器IP通信；\n这些容器还不在同一个网络中，因此它们不能直接相互通信。\n将container2连接到网络:\n这些容器现在共享一个网络，使它们能够彼此通信:\n使用Host模式网络\n桥接网络是常用的连接容器的方式。\n再探讨一下主机网络的功能，其中容器直接连接到主机的网络接口。\n执行下面命令：\nNGINX默认侦听端口80。因为容器使用的是主机网络，所以可以访问主机本地主机上的 NGINX服务器: 80，即使没有显式绑定端口:\n使用None模式网络\n使用none配置容器网络时，容器将没有可用的连接——无论是到其他容器，还是到其他网络。通过将容器网络配置为none禁用网络:\n这样可以轻松地对未知服务进行沙箱处理。\n从网络配置中删除容器\nDocker允许在不重新启动容器的情况下自由地管理网络连接。\n在上一节中，了解了如何在容器创建后连接容器;\n还可以从不再需要的网络中删除容器:\n这些变更不需要重启会立即生效；\n管理容器的网络配置\n列出网络配置\n删除网络配置\n删除没有使用的网络配置\n使用Docker Compose配置容器网络\n[docker compose](Docker Compose overview | Docker Docs)\n可以使用带有 Docker Compose 服务的网络。\n使用 Docker Compose 时，通常可以避免手动网络配置，因为Docker Compose中配置的服务会自动添加到共享网桥网络中:\n创建 docker-compose.yaml\n使用 docker compose 部署服务：\n如下面的输出所示，Docker Compose 已经为相关服务创建了一个包含两个容器的网络:\n应用程序容器可以直接与关联的mysql数据库容器通信:\n其他网络配置\n可以在 Docker Compose 文件中定义其他网络。\n在最外层添加 networks 字段，然后通过networks中配置网络来连接服务:\n这个示例重写默认网络配置。现在，只有app服务可以与mysql通信。helper服务无法到达数据库，因为这两个服务不共享网络。\nDocker Compose - What is It, Example &amp; Tutorial\n总结\nDocker的网络为容器与其他容器、宿主机之间的通信提供了灵活的选择。\n网络中的容器能够通过名称或 IP 地址相互联系。\n网络是由一组可插拔的驱动程序实现的，这些驱动程序可以适用与常见的使用场景。\n网络依赖于主机的网络栈，但是使用命名空间进行隔离。\n这种分离比虚拟机使用的虚拟网络模型要弱，尽管在将容器连接到 macvlan 网络时，它们仍然可以作为物理网络设备出现。\n参考文档\nNetworking with standalone containers | Docker

伯克希尔股东大会问答）的最新公开访谈中，抽象出可在“投资与做事”中反复使用的通用原则。全文力求简洁可执行。\n第一性原理框架\n目标导向：先问“我真正要的长期结果是什么”。\n因果核查：对每个决策追问“为什么”，直到原因不再依赖假设。\n约束识别：明确边界（能力圈、风险承受、时间与资金）。\n长期视角：以 5–20 年衡量正确性，允许短期噪声。\n简单优先：优先选择少决策、可复用的简单策略。\n来自段永平的关键要点（抽象）\n慢即是快：好投资者做得“很慢”，不在乎错过机会，重在避雷与做对事（见浙大问答）[来源1][来源2][来源3]。\n风险边界：敢冒险，但只冒“能承受的风险”，不可复制的“走运”不要当策略（网易、苹果案例）[来源2][来源3]。\n长期主义：每个决策都看 5/10/20 年以后是否仍然正确；学习与创业同理[来源1][来源2]。\n能力圈与理解：对生意、文化、商业模式没有深入理解，就不会长期持有[来源2][来源3]。\n不为创业而创业：该创业的人不需要鼓励；若无清晰要做的事，仅为“创业而创业”成功率极低[来源2][来源3]。\n正直与本分：做对的事情、把事情做对；选择正直可让决策更坦然、更可持续（长期文化）[来源3][来源4]。\n来自巴菲特的关键要点（抽象）\n贸易与合作：贸易不应被当作武器；国家与企业都应做“自己最擅长的事”[来源5][来源6]。\n现金与耐心：持有现金为“机会准备”，真正的机会来时要快速行动[来源4][来源7]。\n能力圈投资：买股票就是买企业的一部分；以企业长期经济特性与资产负债表为核心[来源7]。\n抗噪性：市场大幅波动不改变价值评估；价格是噪声、价值是航标[来源7]。\n文化与传承：强文化与正确的资本配置哲学比技巧更重要；传承到阿贝尔但原则不变[来源4][来源7]。\n10 条可执行的通用智慧\n定义“长期正确”：先写下 5–20 年后的期望，倒推今日行动。\n只做可承受损失的试错：把最大亏损当作“学费”明确标注。\n立足能力圈：不懂的生意不碰；少而精地研究与持有。\n以资产负债表看企业：现金流与资产质量优先于噪声指标。\n把价格当噪声、把价值当航标：用估值与竞争优势对齐持有逻辑。\n预置“机会现金”：平时耐心，机会来临快决策。\n文化优先于技巧：选择/打造正直、长期主义的环境。\n少做决定、做对决定：建立可复用的简单策略与清单。\n风险分层与边界：明确仓位上限、集中度上限、流动性底线。\n不为了“创业而创业”：只有当问题与解法都清楚时再下注。\n一页清单（落地）\n目标：写下 3 个 10 年后的“必须成立”的结果与衡量指标。\n能力圈：列出 2–4 个你“持续能解释的优势行业/公司”。\n风险边界：三条红线（最大回撤、单一标的上限、杠杆=0）。\n现金与耐心：设置机会资金比例；非机会期只做阅读与跟踪。\n决策复盘：每次买卖写 3 条因果与假设，季度复盘改错。\n参考与来源\n[来源1]

AI 时代，“Prompt Engineering”（提示词工程）似乎成了一门显学。但剥去技术的外衣，其内核依然是人类几千年来不断探索的**“提问的艺术”**。\n与其在网上搜寻零散的“咒语”或模板，不如回归经典。本文基于 10 本关于提问与思考的经典著作，探讨如何将其中的智慧迁移到与大模型（LLM）的对话中，实现真正的高效交互。\n一、基础篇：构建“好问题”的骨架\n很多时候，AI 回答不好，是因为我们问得太“随意”。这一阶段的目标是消除歧义。\n1. 识别假设与边界 ——《学会提问》\n原著精华：\nNeil Browne 在书中提出了“海绵式思维”与“淘金式思维”的区别。关键在于识别价值观假设（Value Assumptions）和描述性假设（Descriptive Assumptions）。很多争论无果，是因为双方预设的前提不同。\nAI 对话迁移：\n大模型本质上是一个巨大的“补全机器”，它会倾向于顺从用户的隐含假设，哪怕这个假设是错的（这常导致幻觉）。\n核心策略：显性化假设（Make Assumptions Explicit）。\n实战案例：\n❌ Bad Prompt: “为什么 Java 比 Go 慢？”\n问题：隐含了“Java 一定慢”的描述性假设，迫使 AI 寻找证据支持这个偏见。\n✅ Good Prompt: “在高并发微服务场景下（场景边界），请从启动时间、吞吐量、内存占用三个维度（评价标准），客观对比 Java 21（虚拟线程）与 Go 1.22 的性能差异。请列出支持 Java 性能更优的反直觉场景。”\n优化点：移除了偏见，设定了版本和场景，甚至利用“淘金式思维”要求 AI 提供反例。\n2. 批判性思维的底层 ——《批判性思维》\n原著精华：\nRichard Paul 提出了“思维的八要素”：目的、问题、信息、概念、假设、意涵、观点、推论。一个严谨的思维过程必须覆盖这些维度。\nAI 对话迁移：\n不要只给 AI 一个关键词，要给它一个完整的“思考框架”。这对应了 Prompt Engineering 中的 Context（背景） 和 Constraints（约束）。\n核心策略：结构化指令（Structured Prompting）。\n实战案例：\n❌ Bad Prompt: “帮我写一个贪吃蛇游戏。”\n✅ Good Prompt:\n二、进阶篇：问题的拆解与路径\n当你面对一个复杂任务时，直接丢给 AI 往往得不到满意的结果。你需要学会“教”AI 拆解问题。\n3. 通用解题路径 ——《如何解决问题》\n原著精华：\n数学家 George Pólya 提出的解题四部曲是工程思维的基石：\n理解问题（未知量是什么？已知数据是什么？）\n制定计划（你见过类似的问题吗？能通过辅助线解决吗？）\n执行计划\n回顾（能检验结果吗？）\nAI 对话迁移：\n这完全对应了 思维链（Chain of Thought, CoT） 技术。\n核心策略：分步推理（Step-by-Step Reasoning）。\n实战案例：\n任务：设计一个高可用分布式的 ID 生成器。\nPrompt:\n请基于《如何解决问题》的四步法来辅助我设计：\n理解阶段：请先向我提问，确认我对 QPS、有序性、长度等具体需求。\n计划阶段：对比 UUID、Snowflake、数据库号段模式的优劣，推荐一个方案。\n执行阶段：给出推荐方案的核心伪代码。\n回顾阶段：指出该方案在时钟回拨或多机房同步时的潜在风险。\n4. 发现真正的问题 ——《问题的本质》\n原著精华：\n书中强调“关注缺失的信息”（Noticing what is not there）。多数人失败不是因为找不到答案，而是一开始就解决了一个错误的问题（Type III Error）。\nAI 对话迁移：\n核心策略：元提问（Meta-Prompting），让 AI 充当“红队”或“质疑者”。\n实战案例：\nPrompt: “我打算开发一个针对大学生的社交 App，主打匿名吐槽。请不要直接生成方案，先作为风控专家和产品战略顾问，分析这个想法在 2025 年面临的 3 个最大‘隐形’风险（非显而易见的技术问题，而是监管、心理或市场层面的黑天鹅）。”\n三、心法篇：对话中的博弈与引导\n与 AI 对话，本质上也是一种沟通。虽然它没有情感，但它会模拟人类的沟通模式。\n5. 明确意图与语境 ——《关键对话》\n原著精华：\n在高风险对话中，首先要建立安全感（Make it Safe），并明确共同目的（Shared Purpose）。\nAI 对话迁移：\n当 AI 触发安全拦截（Refusal）或回答跑偏时，不要在那一刻强行对抗。\n核心策略：语境重构（Context Reframing）。\n实战案例：\n场景：你想了解 SQL 注入原理以进行防御，但 AI 拒绝回答“如何攻击”。\n❌ Bad Prompt: “快告诉我怎么攻击这个数据库！”（触发攻击性检测）\n✅ Good Prompt: “我是一名网络安全讲师（Persona），正在编写企业的安全防御手册（Shared Purpose）。为了演示漏洞的危害性，我需要一个用于教学环境的 SQL 注入原理示例（Safe Context），请重点解释该漏洞产生的原因及修复代码。”\n6. 引导而非对抗 ——《非暴力沟通》\n原著精华：\n沟通四要素：观察（Observation）、感受（Feeling）、需要（Needs）、请求（Requests）。重点在于区分“观察”（事实）与“评论”（主观），以及提出“具体的请求”。\nAI 对话迁移：\n核心策略：正向且具体的指令（Positive &amp; Specific Constraints）。\n实战案例：\n❌ Bad Prompt (评论式): “这代码写得太烂了，乱七八糟，改一下。”\n✅ Good Prompt (观察+需求): “我注意到这段代码中有 3 层嵌套循环（观察），导致可读性较差。我需要提升它的维护性（需要）。请将其重构为函数式写法，或将内部逻辑提取为独立方法（具体请求）。”\n四、思想篇：苏格拉底式的追问\n7. 追问的艺术 —— 柏拉图对话录 /《苏格拉底式提问法》\n原著精华：\n“产婆术”（Maieutics）：不直接给答案，而是通过连续追问，让对方自己发现逻辑矛盾，从而逼近真理。\nAI 对话迁移：\n核心策略：反向辅导（Flip the Interaction）。让 AI 当老师，你当学生；或者让 AI 当苏格拉底，审视你的观点。\n实战案例：\nPrompt: “我正在构思一篇关于‘Web3 的未来’的文章。请扮演苏格拉底，不要直接给我大纲。请阅读我的核心论点：[插入观点]，然后向我提出 3 个尖锐的质疑，指出我逻辑中的漏洞，迫使我通过回答来完善论证。”\n五、认知升级：对抗大脑的偷懒\n8. 启动系统 2 ——《思考，快与慢》\n原著精华：\n丹尼尔·卡尼曼指出大脑有两套系统：系统 1（快、直觉、无意识、易出错）和 系统 2（慢、理性、逻辑、费力）。\nAI 对话迁移：\nLLM 的“下一个词预测”机制天然类似于“系统 1”，它倾向于给出概率最高的平庸回答。你需要通过 Prompt 强制唤醒它的“系统 2”。\n核心策略：强制慢思考（Force System 2）。\n实战案例：\nPrompt: “在回答这个问题之前，请先列出 5 个可能的解决方案，并构建一个评分矩阵，从成本、时间、风险三个维度打分。最后，基于总分最高的方案给出详细建议。请深吸一口气，一步步来。”\n9. 多模型思维 ——《穷查理宝典》\n原著精华：\n查理·芒格的“Lollapalooza 效应”：当你通过多个学科（心理学、经济学、物理学）的视角同时审视一个问题时，会产生叠加效应。\nAI 对话迁移：\n核心策略：多专家混合（Mixture of Experts Prompting）。\n实战案例：\nPrompt: “请分别扮演行为经济学家（考虑非理性）、演化生物学家（考虑生存竞争）和科幻小说家（考虑未来可能性）三个角色，以此探讨‘人工智能对人类就业的长期影响’。最后，请综合这三个视角，写一份总结报告。”\n六、总结：给 AI 开发者的书单组合\n如果只能选 3 本书来提升你的 Prompt 能力，我推荐这个“最优组合”：\n入门：《学会提问》\n作用：帮你识别偏见，写出逻辑严密、没有歧义的基础 Prompt。\n方法：《如何解决问题》\n作用：教你掌握 CoT（思维链），学会拆解复杂任务，构建 Agent 的工作流。\n境界：柏拉图《对话录》\n作用：学会迭代与追问，从“问出答案”进阶到“问出本质”。\n记住：真正的提问高手，不是问题多，而是能快速排除 80% 无意义问题的人。 好的 Prompt，就是帮 AI 排除干扰，直击靶心。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/efficient-llm-dialogue-with-classic-books/","title":"向经典致敬：用大师的提问艺术驯服大模型"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/es-index-speed/":{"body":"背景与目标\n背景：在日志/指标/业务数据持续摄入场景下，索引性能直接影响数据可用性与费用成本（CPU、IO 与磁盘）。\n目标：结合官方建议形成可落地的“索引优化清单”，同时明确风险与回滚策略。\n参考：\nElasticsearch 6.8 索引速度优化：https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.8/tune-for-indexing-speed.html#_disable_refresh_and_replicas_for_initial_loads\nElastic Docs 索引速度优化：https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/production-guidance/optimize-performance/indexing-speed\n一页清单（Quick Wins）\n使用 _bulk 批量写入，按基准测试选择合适批次大小（建议请求体控制在数十 MB 内）。\n提高 index.refresh_interval（如 30s），减少段切分与后续合并压力；初始大批量加载可临时设置为 -1。\n初始批量加载时将 index.number_of_replicas: 0，完成后恢复副本数。\n用多线程/多进程并发发送 bulk，监控 429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS 并使用指数退避重试。\n优先使用自动生成 _id，避免查重开销；写入密集的索引给足 index buffer。\n给文件系统缓存留出足够内存（机器内存至少一半给 FS cache，合理控制 JVM heap）。\n采用本地 SSD，避免远程文件系统；需要时用 RAID0 进行条带化，并通过副本与快照保障容错。\n批量写入与并发\n批量大小优化：在单节点/单分片做基准测试，逐步增加批次（100→200→400→…），当速度趋于平稳即为合适大小；过大批次会导致内存压力与失败重试成本升高。\n并发与退避：多线程/多进程并发发送 bulk；遇到 429（EsRejectedExecutionException）说明集群承压，应暂停并指数退避重试。\n刷新与副本：初始加载的加速策略\n提高刷新间隔：减少新段创建频率，降低合并压力并提升写入吞吐。\n初始加载禁用刷新与副本（风险可控）：\n加载完成后恢复设置：\n风险提示：在 replicas=0 与 refresh=-1 期间，任一分片丢失会导致数据丢失；仅在受控窗口期执行并做好快照/备份。\nID 策略与索引缓冲\n自动 ID：使用自动生成 _id 可跳过“同分片查重”，显著降低写入开销，尤其在索引规模增长后。\n索引 Buffer：为重写入分片提升 indices.memory.index_buffer_size，最多让“单个重索引分片”获得约 512MB 的索引缓冲。\n说明：默认 10% 通常足够（10GB 堆约 1GB buffer，可支撑两个重写入分片）；超过 512MB 对单分片收益有限。\n文件系统缓存与存储介质\nFS Cache：将机器内存至少一半留给文件系统缓存以缓冲 IO；避免系统发生 swap（禁用交换或设置 swappiness 很小）。\n存储介质：优先本地 SSD；避免 NFS/SMB 远程文件系统；在云环境下使用有保障的 IOPS（如 EBS 的 provisioned IOPS）。\nRAID0 条带化：提升单分片吞吐，但任一盘故障会破坏索引；通过副本与跨节点冗余降低风险，并定期快照。\n监控与回退\n监控项：bulk 吞吐与失败率、429 比例、刷新/合并耗时、磁盘水位、线程池队列。\n回退策略：一旦出现持续 429 或 IO 饱和，降低并发与批次大小；必要时临时提升刷新间隔或扩容集群资源。\n风险与权衡\n刷新与副本调低：提升吞吐但降低数据与查询可用性；必须在窗口期执行，结束后及时恢复。\n批量与并发过高：可能导致内存压力与失败后重试成本显著增加；基准测试与节流至关重要。\n自动 _id：牺牲“指定 ID 的幂等写入能力”，但换取显著吞吐提升；如需幂等可在上层做去重/幂等逻辑。\n参考\nElasticsearch

and desktop messaging app with a focus on security and speed. It is free to use and extensively hackable. It also has a good bot support system. The API is also easy to implement and has many wrappers for building bots with the API.\nGitHub Actions\nGitHub Actions is a CI/CD runtime for your GitHub repository. You can run almost anything from scripts to docker containers. You can build, test and deploy your code with GitHub Actions. All these actions are called workflows and workflows differ in the job they’re doing. These maybe test workflows, build ones or deployment ones. You can find all the actions on GitHub in the marketplace\nBuilding the Bot\nPrerequisites\nBasic JavaScript Knowledge\nBasic GitHub Knowledge\nTelegram Account\nThere are templates for building actions. Here we’re gonna start from scratch\nEnvironment Setup\nNode, You can download node from their website\nNPM comes with node, so you don’t have to worry about it.\nInitialize the Project\ndotenv, Dotenv can be downloaded via\nnode-telegram-bot-api, node-telegram-bot-api is a simple wrapper for building telegram bots. You can download it via\n@zeit/ncc, NCC is a Simple CLI for compiling a Node.js module into a single file, together with all its dependencies, GCC-style. It’s a dev dependency and can be downloaded\nFolder Structure\nThe dist folder will be automatically created. action.yml will be made\nindex.js is the file we’re defining the bot\naction.yml is the file we’ll define the action and it’s behaviours\nMaking the Bot\nWe need to get an API bot token from telegram. For that Go to Telegram and Search for Botfather. It’s a bot.\nCreate a new bot with the /newbot command and get the API key. We’ll need that, also talk to jsondump bot and get your chat id. The output may be like this, so\nThis will be needed for further use and We need to add it to the repo secrets which can be found in the repo settings. Be careful to add it as token and chat like as shown below\nWriting the Action and Building the Bot\nFire up the terminal/cmd and make a new folder. Install the dependencies. Run the following command\nOpen your favourite text editor within the folder or with the file. We’ll define the bot in index.js\nFirst, we’re defining the dotenv for config and initializing Telegram Bot. Here we’re defining the alias variables for the environment variables. You might notice an INPUT_ for almost every environment variable, this is because GitHub Actions pass the env variable with an INPUT prefix. Other env variables are action’s default environment variables. Then we initialized the bot with the API token.\nGitHub actions could be triggered with Issues, Pull Request or Pushes. You can find the trigger events here. Here we’re gonna get a message from the bot when an Issue or Pull Request or a Push event has happened.\nIn these lines of code, we’re just initializing a switch statement for the responses. We’re also declaring an anonymous function to use the switch responses via a function later. We’re using all the defined variables in the switch. You can check the trigger Events to get how the event is triggered and what keyword should be used.\nNow for the last part of the Js file, we just take the response from the switch and assign it to a constant. Then we use the sendMessage function of the node-telegram-bot-api to send the message to the bot with the chatid and the output as the arguments.\nbot.sendMessage(chatid,output,{parse_mode : “Markdown”})\nCompiling and Minifying the Js code\nSince we have installed @zeit/ncc and this is used for the making the whole program with all the APIs to a single file and we need to use NCC for that. We just need to run\nor you might wanna add the following to you package.json file, and run npm run test to compile and minify the code.\nThis will create a dist folder with and index.js file which contains the compiled code.\nMaking it a valid action\nFor making this Js file a valid action, we need to add an action.yml file. The action.yml for this action is like this\nHere we’re defining the Input variables to be loaded for the action in GitHub’s runtime environemt. All these default data are taken from the response of the webhooks which are send by GitHub when a trigger event is occured. You can find out more in the Action Documentation Here.\nHere we are defining that this is a node action and should run in an environment with node, and the file which should be run, here the index.js file in the dist folder. That should do it. Create a new commit and push it to a repo. Create a new tag and this action will appear in the marketplace.\nDefining a workflow to test your action\nGitHub Action workflows are defined using the .yml syntax. Here is an example of a sample workflow for this action\nThe Complete code for the bot is\nYou can try out many different items using actions and this is just a sample action to get you started.

WAL 机制"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hbase/11-flush-mechanism/":{"body":"在 HBase 的 LSM-Tree 架构中，数据首先写入内存中的 MemStore。当 MemStore 达到一定大小时，需要将数据刷写（Flush）到磁盘生成 HFile。Flush 机制是连接内存与磁盘的关键桥梁，它直接影响写入性能、内存使用率以及后续的 Compaction 压力。\n本文将基于 HBase 2.x 源码，深入分析 Flush 的触发时机、核心流程以及相关策略。\n1. Flush 的触发时机 (Trigger)\nHBase 中触发 Flush 的条件非常多样，不仅限于 MemStore 大小，还涉及 RegionServer 的内存压力、WAL 文件数量等。\n1.1 MemStore 级别限制 (Region Level)\n这是最常见的触发方式。当一个 Region 中所有 MemStore 的大小总和超过阈值时，会触发 Flush。\n参数: hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size (默认 128MB)\n行为: 这是一个 Soft Limit。当达到此值时，RegionServer 会请求 Flush 该 Region，但不会阻塞写请求。\n1.2 RegionServer 全局内存限制 (Global Level)\n为了防止 RegionServer OOM，HBase 有全局的内存限制。\n低水位 (Low Watermark): hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size.lower.limit (默认堆内存 * 0.4 * 0.95)\n当 RS 上所有 MemStore 总大小超过此值，会强制 Flush 占用内存最大的 Region，直到总大小降到低水位以下。此时不会阻塞写，但在日志中会有警告。\n高水位 (High Watermark): hbase.regionserver.global.memstore.size (默认堆内存 * 0.4)\n当 RS 上所有 MemStore 总大小超过此值，会阻塞该 RS 上的所有写请求，并强制 Flush，直到内存回落到低水位。这是非常严重的性能卡顿点。\n1.3 Region 级别阻塞限制 (Blocking)\n如果某个 Region 的 MemStore 持续增长（写入速度 &gt; Flush 速度），达到了 Flush Size 的倍数，为了保护 RS，会阻塞该 Region 的写请求。\n参数: hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier (默认 4)\n阈值: flush.size * block.multiplier (默认 128MB * 4 = 512MB)\n行为: 阻塞写请求，直到 Flush 完成。\n1.4 WAL 数量限制\n为了限制故障恢复（Replay WAL）的时间，HBase 不允许保留过多的 WAL 文件。\n参数: hbase.regionserver.maxlogs (默认 32)\n行为: 当 WAL 文件数量超过阈值，会找到最老的 WAL 对应的 Region 进行 Flush，以便可以归档旧的 WAL 文件。\n1.5 定期 Flush\n即使没有写请求，为了数据安全，HBase 也会定期 Flush。\n参数: hbase.regionserver.optionalcacheflushinterval (默认 3600000ms = 1小时)\n行为: 只有当 MemStore 大小大于 0 且上次 Flush 距离现在超过间隔时触发。\n1.6 手动 Flush\n用户可以通过 Shell (flush 'tableName') 或 Admin API 手动触发。\n2. 核心类概览\n在深入流程之前，先认识几个关键类：\nHRegion: Region 的核心实现，负责处理 Put/Get 请求，也是 Flush 的发起者。\nMemStoreFlusher: RegionServer 内部的后台线程（Chore），维护一个 Flush 队列 (FlushQueue)，负责异步执行 Flush 任务。\nHStore: 对应一个 Column Family，包含 MemStore 和 StoreFiles。\nDefaultStoreFlusher: 具体的 Flush 逻辑实现者，负责将内存数据写成 HFile。\n3. Flush 核心流程 (Process)\nFlush 的执行过程大致可以分为三个阶段：Prepare (准备)、Flush (刷写)、Commit (提交)。\n3.1 阶段一：Prepare (准备阶段)\n此阶段在 HRegion.internalFlushcache 中进行。目标是创建 MemStore 的快照 (Snapshot)。\n加写锁 / 更新锁: 阻塞对该 Region 的更新操作（或者更细粒度的锁），确保内存状态一致性。\n创建快照: 遍历 Region 下的所有 Store，调用 Store.snapshot()。\n这步操作非常快，只是将当前的 Active MemStore 切换为 Snapshot MemStore，并创建一个新的空 Active MemStore 接收新写入。\n释放锁: 快照创建完成后，立即释放锁。\n关键点: 这里实现了 Non-Blocking Flush。只有在创建快照的短暂时间内会阻塞写，后续的磁盘 IO 过程不会阻塞写请求。\n3.2 阶段二：Flush (刷写阶段)\n此阶段比较耗时，主要是磁盘 IO 操作。\n选择 Store: 根据 Flush 策略（如 FlushAllLargeStoresPolicy），决定哪些 Store 需要刷写。\n执行刷写: 对每个需要刷写的 Store，调用 StoreFlusher.flushSnapshot()。\n遍历 Snapshot 中的 KeyValue。\n通过 StoreFileWriter 将 KeyValue 写入临时目录下的 HFile 文件。\n追加 MemStore 扫描: 如果在刷写过程中有新的数据写入（因为锁已释放），这些新数据在新的 Active MemStore 中，不会包含在本次 Flush 中。\n3.3 阶段三：Commit (提交阶段)\nIO 完成后，需要更新元数据并清理快照。\n移动文件: 将 HFile 从临时目录移动到正式的 Region 目录下。\n加载 Reader: 创建 StoreFile 对象并加载 Reader，将其加入到 StoreFileManager 中，此时新生成的 HFile 对读请求可见。\n清理快照: 清空 Snapshot MemStore，释放内存。\n更新 WAL: 记录 Flush Marker 到 WAL 中，表示该 SequenceId 之前的数据已持久化，对应的旧 WAL 可以被清理了。\n4. 源码调用链分析\n5. 关键问题与调优\n5.1 为什么会产生小文件？\n如果 Flush 过于频繁（例如 flush.size 设置过小，或者因为全局内存压力导致强制 Flush），会生成大量小的 HFile。\n后果: 增加 Compaction 压力，影响读取性能。\n解决: 调大 hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size，合理设置全局内存水位。\n5.2 Flush 对读写的影响\n对写: 正常情况下影响微乎其微（毫秒级锁）。但如果触发 Blocking 机制（MemStore 积压），写请求会被严重阻塞。\n对读: Flush 完成后，新的 HFile 加入，可能会触发 Minor Compaction，短时间内增加 IO 压力，但长期看有助于减少 MemStore 扫描开销。\n5.3 调优建议\n增加 Flush Size: 在内存允许的情况下，尽量调大 hbase.hregion.memstore.flush.size (如 256MB)，减少 Flush 频率和 HFile 数量。\n调整 Blocking 倍数: 如果写入突发流量大，可以适当调大 hbase.hregion.memstore.block.multiplier，给系统更多缓冲时间。\n关注日志: 监控日志中出现的 Too many store files 或 Blocking updates 警告。\n6. 总结\nHBase 的 Flush 机制是 LSM-Tree 实现的核心环节。它巧妙地通过“快照+异步IO”实现了高吞吐的写入，同时通过多级触发策略保证了内存的安全。理解 Flush 流程对于排查写入性能抖动（Write Stalls）至关重要。\nNext: HBase 源码阅读：12.

Master/Slave 架构\nHDFS 采用经典的 Master/Slave 架构：\nNameNode (Master): 中心管理者。\n职责: 管理文件系统命名空间 (Namespace)，维护文件到 Block 的映射，处理客户端请求。\n特点: 单点（HA 方案解决单点故障），内存受限（所有元数据在内存）。\nDataNode (Slave): 工作节点。\n职责: 存储实际的数据块 (Block)，执行数据块的读写操作，定期向 NameNode 汇报块信息。\n特点: 数量众多，易故障。\n为什么是单 Master？\nGFS 论文中提到：\n“Having a single master vastly simplifies our design and enables the master to make sophisticated chunk placement and replication decisions using global knowledge.”\n单 Master 极大简化了元数据一致性问题，避免了分布式锁和复杂的共识算法（在元数据层面）。当然，这也带来了扩展性瓶颈（内存限制），后来 HDFS Federation 解决了这个问题。\n2. Block 的设计哲学\n文件被切割成固定大小的 Block（默认 128MB）。\n为什么 Block 这么大？\n减少元数据开销: NameNode 内存有限，Block 越大，同样大小的文件产生的元数据越少。\n最小化寻址开销: 如果 Block 太小，读取大文件时需要频繁 seek 磁盘。128MB 使得传输时间远大于寻址时间，从而获得接近磁盘顺序读写的吞吐量。\n3. 核心通信协议 (RPC)\nHDFS 内部各组件通过 RPC (Remote Procedure Call) 交互。Hadoop 有一套自己的 RPC 框架（基于 Protobuf）。\n主要的 Protocol 接口定义在 hadoop-hdfs-client 和 hadoop-hdfs 模块中：\nClientProtocol: Client &lt;-&gt; NameNode。\n方法: create, open, mkdir, getBlockLocations, renewLease 等。\nClientDatanodeProtocol: Client &lt;-&gt; DataNode。\n方法: recoverBlock, getReplicaVisibleLength。\n注意: 真正的数据读写不走 RPC，而是流式接口 (Data Transfer Protocol)。\nDatanodeProtocol: DataNode &lt;-&gt; NameNode。\n方法: registerDatanode, sendHeartbeat, blockReport。\nInterDatanodeProtocol: DataNode &lt;-&gt; DataNode。\n用于数据块恢复 (Block Recovery) 和更新副本。\n4. 数据流 vs 控制流\n控制流 (Control Flow): 走 RPC。如 Client 问 NameNode “文件 A 的 Block 在哪？”。\n数据流 (Data Flow): 走 TCP 流 (Netty)。如 Client 直接连接 DataNode 写入数据。\n这种分离设计保证了 NameNode 不会成为数据传输的瓶颈。\n5. 下一步\n了解了架构图后，我们将从 NameNode 的启动流程开始，看看这个庞大的 Master 是如何被唤醒的。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hdfs/02-architecture/","title":"HDFS 源码阅读：02. 核心架构设计"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hdfs/03-namenode-startup/":{"body":"NameNode 是 HDFS 的大脑，它的启动过程决定了整个集群何时可用。\n1. 入口：NameNode.main()\n一切始于 org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.server.namenode.NameNode 类的 main 方法。\ncreateNameNode 方法会解析命令行参数（如 -format, -recover, -upgrade），如果只是正常启动，最终会调用 new NameNode(conf)。\n2. 初始化核心组件 (initialize)\n在构造函数中，核心逻辑都在 initialize(conf) 方法里。\n3. 加载元数据 (FSNamesystem.loadFromDisk)\nloadNamesystem 会创建 FSNamesystem 对象，并调用其 loadFromDisk 方法。这是启动过程中最耗时的步骤。\n加载 FSImage: 读取最新的 Checkpoint 文件，恢复内存中的 INode 树。\n回放 EditLog: 读取 FSImage 之后的 EditLog，将操作重做到内存树上。\n保存新 Image (可选): 如果配置了 dfs.namenode.checkpoint.check.user.provider 等，可能会触发。\n4. 启动 RPC 服务\nNameNode 通常启动两个 RPC Server：\nServiceRpcServer: 专门处理 DataNode 的心跳、块汇报等请求。避免 Client 流量把 DataNode 挤掉。\nClientRpcServer: 处理 Client 的 ls, mkdir 等请求。\n5. 进入安全模式 (SafeMode)\n启动初期，NameNode 内存中虽然有了文件目录树，但没有 Block 的位置信息（BlockMap 是空的）。\nBlock 的位置信息不会持久化在磁盘，必须等 DataNode 启动并汇报。\n因此，NameNode 启动后自动进入 SafeMode（只读模式）：\n等待 DataNode 汇报 Block。\n统计已汇报的 Block 比例（默认阈值 99.9%）。\n达到阈值后，再等待 30 秒（dfs.namenode.safemode.extension），然后退出 SafeMode。\n6. 总结\nNameNode 启动不仅是加载磁盘数据，更依赖于全网 DataNode 的参与来重建完整的元数据视图。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hdfs/03-namenode-startup/","title":"HDFS 源码阅读：03.

INode 类层次结构\nHDFS 的目录树完全驻留在内存中。\nINode: 抽象基类，定义了 id, name, permission, modificationTime, accessTime, parent 等通用属性。\nINodeDirectory: 表示目录。内部有一个 children 列表（通常是 ArrayList 或 ReadOnlyList）。\nINodeFile: 表示文件。核心属性是 BlockInfo[] blocks，指向文件包含的数据块。\nINodeSymlink: 符号链接。\n2. 内存优化\n为了在有限的内存中存下数亿个文件，HDFS 做了极致优化：\n整数编码: 权限、用户、组等信息被压缩在一个 long 类型中 (PermissionStatusFormat)。\n定长数组: INodeDirectory 的 children 尽量使用定长数组，减少对象头开销。\nUTF-8 字节: 文件名存储为 byte[] 而不是 String（Java String 开销大）。\n3. 全局锁 vs 细粒度锁\n在早期版本，NameNode 使用一把全局读写锁 (FSNamesystemLock)。\n所有元数据操作（如 mkdir）都需要获取这把锁。\nHadoop 2.x/3.x 引入了细粒度锁 (Fine-grained Locking) 的尝试，但在 FSDirectory 层面，大部分操作依然依赖 FSNamesystem 的全局锁来保证一致性。\n4. 目录树操作\n以 mkdir 为例：\nRPC 入口: NameNodeRpcServer.mkdirs\nFSNamesystem: 获取写锁 (writeLock())。\nFSDirectory: mkdirs -&gt; unprotectedMkdir。\nEditLog: 记录操作 (logMkDir)。\n释放锁: 操作完成。\n5. 快照 (Snapshot)\nHDFS 支持目录级别的快照。\n当对目录 /data 创建快照 s1 时，HDFS 不会复制该目录下的所有 INode。而是采用 Copy-on-Write (写时复制) 机制。\nINodeDirectory 会维护一个 DirectoryWithSnapshotFeature。\n当修改某个文件时，会记录其修改前的状态（Diff List）。\n读取快照时，通过应用 Diff List 还原出当时的状态。\n这使得创建快照非常快（O(1)），且节省内存。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hdfs/04-fsdirectory/","title":"HDFS 源码阅读：04. 元数据管理 (FSDirectory)"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hdfs/05-fsimage-editlog/":{"body":"为了保证数据不丢失，NameNode 必须将内存中的元数据持久化到磁盘。\n1. 核心概念\nFSImage: 某一时刻文件系统元数据的完整快照。\nEditLog: 记录自上一次 FSImage 以来所有的写操作（事务日志）。\n当前状态 = FSImage + EditLog\n2. FSEditLog 双缓冲机制 (Double Buffer)\n如果每来一个写请求都强制刷盘 (fsync)，性能会非常差。HDFS 采用了双缓冲机制来批量刷盘。\n流程 (logSync):\n写入: 多个线程同时往 bufCurrent 写入操作记录。\n交换: 当需要刷盘时，抢占锁，交换 bufCurrent 和 bufReady。后续线程写入新的 bufCurrent。\n刷盘: 将 bufReady 中的数据一次性写入磁盘（JournalSet）。\n完成: 清空 bufReady。\n这种机制实现了并发写入内存，串行刷盘，极大提高了吞吐量。\n3.

Kafka 的独特优化：DelayQueue 驱动时间轮\n标准的简单时间轮通常有一个线程死循环，每隔固定时间（比如 1ms）醒来一次“拨动”指针。这被称为 Busy Waiting。\n如果任务非常稀疏（例如大部分时候桶都是空的），这种空转非常浪费 CPU。\nKafka 做了一个极其聪明的优化：使用 DelayQueue 来管理时间轮的“桶”，而不是“任务”。\n每个非空的 Bucket（注意是 Bucket，不是 Task）被作为一个 Item 放入 DelayQueue。\nDelayQueue 的过期时间设置为 Bucket 的过期时间。\n线程只需要 DelayQueue.poll()。如果最近的桶是 100ms 后过期，线程就会挂起 100ms，而不是每 1ms 醒来一次。\n为什么这样更快？\n虽然又用回了 DelayQueue，但现在的元素数量不再是任务数（Millions），而是非空桶的数量（通常只有几十个）。在元素极少的情况下，DelayQueue 的 O(log n) 开销几乎可以忽略不计。\n4. 深度对比：DelayQueue vs Hierarchical Timing Wheel\n特性Java DelayQueue (Old)Hierarchical Timing Wheel (New)\n插入复杂度O(log N)O(1) (O(m)，m为层数，极小)\n删除复杂度O(log N)O(1) (双向链表移除)\n随机删除支持困难 (通常需 O(n) 扫描)完美支持 (持有引用即可删除)\n内存开销高 (包含大量已完成但未移除的僵尸任务)低 (及时移除，仅存活任务占用内存)\nCPU 开销高 (频繁重排堆，Reaper 线程扫描)低 (仅处理过期桶，无空转)\n适用场景任务量小，对精确度要求极高海量任务，高吞吐，允许极微小误差\n5. 总结\nKafka Purgatory 的重构是数据结构优化的经典案例。它告诉我们：\n特定场景特定分析：通用数据结构（如 JDK 的 DelayQueue）能解决问题，但在极端规模下可能不是最优解。\n组合优于单一：Kafka 并没有完全抛弃 DelayQueue，而是将其用于驱动时间轮的推进，结合了 DelayQueue 的阻塞特性和时间轮的 O(1) 读写特性。\n空间换时间与分层思想：通过分层数组索引（哈希）来代替堆排序，大大降低了 CPU 消耗。\n对于构建类似的高性能定时任务系统（如 RPC 超时管理、心跳检测、游戏服务器 Buff 计时），分层时间轮无疑是首选方案。\n参考资料\nApache Kafka Purgatory Redesign Proposal\nHierarchical Timing Wheels Paper","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/hierarchical-timing-wheels-analysis/","title":"深入解析时间轮（Timing Wheel）：从 Kafka Purgatory 看高效定时任务调度"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/high-performance-low-latency-handbook/":{"body":"核心原则\n明确目标：以端到端延迟、99/99.9 分位、吞吐、稳定性为一等指标，避免只优化平均值。\n数据驱动：先度量后优化，建立可复现的基准与环境隔离，避免“改参数碰运气”。\n贴近瓶颈：围绕 CPU、内存、锁、I/O、网络、存储逐层定位，逐个消除；不要平均用力。\n简化路径：减少层次、减少拷贝、减少分配、减少上下文切换、减少序列化复杂度。\n面向故障设计：考虑抖动、拥塞、反压、尾延迟的治理与保护带（降级、限流、超时）。\n架构与模式\n零拷贝与最少拷贝：sendfile、splice、mmap；缓冲复用与批处理（batching）。\n内存池与对象复用：绕过频繁 malloc/free，用 slab/pool、arena（jemalloc/tcmalloc）。\n无锁与低锁：无锁环形队列、读写锁分离、分段锁、尽量使用原子与 CAS。\n异步与事件驱动：io_uring、epoll、kqueue、AIO；避免阻塞调用和线程爆炸。\n数据面/控制面分离：热路径最短化，慢路径（日志、遥测、管理）异步或旁路。\n背压与负载整形：生产者-消费者配额、漏桶/令牌桶、优雅丢弃（tail-drop）与降级策略。\n语言与运行时\nC/C++：\n使用 -O2/-O3、-march=native、-flto；热点用 restrict/constexpr/inline。\n明确对象生命周期，避免小对象频繁分配；内联小函数，消除虚调用开销。\nRust：\nno_std 场景下最短路径；tokio/monoio 选择基于工作负载；善用 #[inline] 与 Pin。\n使用 tracing 收敛热路径指标；bytes/smallvec 降低分配。\nGo：\n减少逃逸与分配；控制 GOMAXPROCS；用 pprof/trace 定位 GC 与调度热点。\n大量并发时首选通道背压或工作池；避免每请求起新 goroutine。\nJava/JVM：\n选择适合延迟目标的 GC（G1/ZGC/Shenandoah）；合理 Xms=Xmx、MaxGCPauseMillis。\n直堆外内存 DirectByteBuffer/Netty PooledByteBufAllocator；避免对象风暴。\n内存与对象管理\n分配器：jemalloc/tcmalloc 替换系统 malloc，降低碎片与锁争用。\nNUMA 与局部性：numactl --cpunodebind --membind；尽量让线程与数据同节点。\n缓存友好：紧凑结构体、消除 false-sharing（使用 cacheline 对齐）；预取 __builtin_prefetch。\n批处理：批量分配/释放、批量序列化；减少系统调用次数与锁进入次数。\n并发与锁\n尽量用无锁结构：环形缓冲、MPSC/MCSP 队列；热点读路径用 RCU/版本号。\n降低锁粒度：分段锁、局部计数、跨线程通信用消息传递代替共享状态。\n自旋与阻塞平衡：短临界区自旋，长临界区阻塞；避免在热路径打印日志或做 I/O。\nI/O 与网络\n网络栈：\n优先 epoll/kqueue/io_uring；减少阻塞套接字；禁用 Nagle（TCP_NODELAY）。\n调优 SO_RCVBUF/SO_SNDBUF、TCP_QUICKACK；根据场景考虑 busy-poll。\n协议设计：\n序列化选择以延迟为先：flatbuffers/capnproto/自定义紧凑二进制；避免深层嵌套 JSON。\n明确超时、重试与幂等；避免惊群（accept 多线程）与 head-of-line 阻塞。\n工具与压测：wrk/fortio/iperf3/tc；使用 flamegraph 识别热函数。\n存储与持久化\n日志落盘：异步、批量、顺序写；日志与数据面分离磁盘或队列。\n数据库：选择适合延迟目标的引擎（LSM vs B-Tree），按工作负载调优写放大与缓存命中。\n缓存层：本地 LRU/LFU、跨节点一致性哈希；避免穿透与雪崩（限流、预热、降级）。\n操作系统与内核\n进程/线程：合理 taskset 绑核，降低迁移；为关键线程提升调度类与优先级。\n文件与磁盘：O_DIRECT/O_NONBLOCK 场景化选择；I/O 调度器选择 none/mq-deadline。\n网络设备：ethtool 关闭不必要的 offload，按负载调节 RPS/RFS/XPS 与队列并行度。\n系统参数：sysctl 中 net.core.*、net.ipv4.* 根据并发与突发特性进行整形。\n可观测性与分析\n采样与火焰图：perf/bcc/async-profiler/pprof；以采样证据驱动优化。\n端到端追踪：OpenTelemetry/Jaeger；记录关键自定义 span 和业务标签。\n指标分位：暴露 p50/p95/p99/p99.9 与队列深度、等待时间、批量大小、重试次数。\n压测分层：协议层、业务层、系统层分别压测；构建稳定、可复现的基准环境。\n优化流程（建议）\n建立基准：选定代表性负载与数据规模，固定环境变量与参数快照。\n定位瓶颈：用火焰图/追踪对齐指标（CPU、GC、锁、I/O）；画出关键路径图。\n设计改动：优先零拷贝、批处理、对象复用、减少锁与系统调用；明确风险与回滚。\n渐进验证：小步提交，灰度发布；以分位数回归标准判断有效性。\n持续监控：上线后观察尾延迟与抖动，必要时加保护带（限流/降级/重试退避）。\n常见陷阱\n只看平均值不看分位尾巴，导致生产抖动被忽视。\n大量细粒度 goroutine/线程造成调度震荡与上下文切换风暴。\n对象风暴与无界队列，GC 或 OOM 尾延迟飙升。\n过度序列化/反序列化与拷贝；日志同步写阻塞热路径。\n盲目调大缓冲与并发，反而引起排队与头阻塞。\n速查清单\nCPU：绑定热点线程、减少分支与虚调用、提升缓存命中。\n内存：池化与批量、NUMA 亲和、消除 false-sharing。\n锁：热点读路径无锁或读写锁、缩短临界区、用消息传递代替共享。\nI/O：异步化、批处理、零拷贝、合理超时与背压。\n网络：TCP_NODELAY、合理缓冲、避免惊群、压测与火焰图定位。\n存储：顺序写、异步刷盘、缓存命中、写放大控制。\n观测：p99/p99.9 指标、端到端追踪；压测稳定可复现。\n参考资料\nPatterns 与资源集合：https://github.com/penberg/awesome-low-latency\nLinux 性能工具：perf、bcc、sysstat、flamegraph、async-profiler\n压测工具：wrk、fortio、hey、iperf3\n序列化：flatbuffers、capnproto、protobuf（谨慎考虑层级与可选字段）\n（本文根据业界低延迟与高性能实践汇总，结合工程经验提炼为可操作的手册式清单，可作为团队性能优化与系统设计的参考。）","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/high-performance-low-latency-handbook/","title":"高性能开发参考手册"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/how-to-ask-questions-the-smart-way/":{"body":"原文链接\n提问的智慧\n艾瑞克.史蒂文.雷蒙德（Eric Steven Raymond）\nThyrsus Enterprises\nesr@thyrsus.com\n瑞克.莫恩（Rick Moen）\nrespond-auto@linuxmafia.com\n版权©2001, 2006 Eric S.

的世界里，你所提技术问题的解答很大程度上取决于你提问的方式与解决此问题的难度，本文将教你如何提问才更有可能得到满意的答复。\n开源程序的应用已经很广，你通常可以从其他更有经验的用户而不是黑客那里得到解答。这是好事，他们一般对新手常有的毛病更容忍一点。然尔，使用我们推荐的方法，象对待黑客那样对待这些有经验的用户，通常能最有效地得到问题的解答。\n第一件需要明白的事是黑客喜欢难题和激发思考的好问题。假如不是这样，我们也不会写本文了。如果你能提出一个有趣的问题让我们咀嚼玩味，我们会感激你。好问题是种激励与礼物，帮助我们发展认知，揭示没有注意或想到的问题。在黑客中，“好问题！” 是非常热烈而认真的赞许。\n此外，黑客还有遇到简单问题就表现出敌视或傲慢的名声。有时，我们看起来还对新手和愚蠢的家伙有条件反射式的无礼，但事情并不真是这样。\n我们只是毫无歉意地敌视那些提问前不愿思考、不做自己家庭作业的人。这种人就象时间无底洞──他们只知道索取，不愿意付出，他们浪费了时间，这些时间本可用于其它更有趣的问题或更值得回答的人。我们将这种人叫做 “失败者（loser）” （由于历史原因，我们有时将“loser”拼写为“lusers” 。）\n我们意识到许多人只是想使用我们写的软件，他们对学习技术细节没有兴趣。对大多数人而言，计算机只是种工具，是种达到目的的手段而已。他们有自己的生活并且有更重要的事要做，我们承认这点，也从不指望每个人都对这些让我们着迷的技术问题感兴趣。不过，我们回答问题的风格是为了适应那些真正对此有兴趣并愿意主动参与解决问题的用户，这一点不会变，也不该变。如果连这都变了，我们就会在自己能做得最好的事情上不再那么犀利。\n我们（大多数）是自愿者， 从自己繁忙的生活中抽时间来回答问题，有时会力不从心。因此，我们会毫不留情地滤除问题，特别是那些看起来象是失败者提的，以便更有效地把回答问题的时间留给那些胜利者。\n如果你认为这种态度令人反感、以施惠者自居或傲慢自大，请检查你的假设，我们并未要求你屈服──事实上，假如你做了该做的努力，我们中的大多数将非常乐意平等地与你交流，并欢迎你接纳我们的文化。试图去帮助那些不愿自救的人对我们简直没有效率。不懂没有关系，但愚蠢地做事不行。\n所以，你不必在技术上很在行才能吸引我们的注意，但你 必须 表现出能引导你在行的姿态──机 敏、有想法、善于观察、乐于主动参与问题的解决。如果你做不到这些使你与众不同的事情，我们建议你付钱跟别人签商业服务合同，而不是要求黑客无偿帮助。\n如果你决定向我们求助，你不会想成为一名失败者，你也不想被看成一个失败者。得到快速有效回答的最好方法是使提问者看起来象个聪明、自信和有想法的人，并且暗示只是碰巧在某一特别问题上需要帮助。\n（欢迎对本文指正，可以将建议发至 esr@thyrsus.com 或 respond-auto@linuxmafia.com。 请注意，本文不想成为一般性的 网络礼仪 指南，我一般会拒绝那些与引出技术论坛中有用的回答不特别相关的建议。）\n提问前\n在通过电邮、新闻组或论坛提技术问题以前，做以下事情：\n尝试在你准备提问论坛的历史文档中搜索答案\n尝试搜索互联网以找到答案\n尝试阅读手册以找到答案\n尝试阅读“常见问题文档”（FAQ）以找到答案\n尝试自己检查或试验以找到答案\n尝试请教懂行的朋友以找到答案\n如果你是程序员，尝试阅读源代码以找到答案\n提问时，请先表明你已做了上述事情，这将有助于建立你不是寄生虫与浪费别人时间的印象。最好再表述你从中 学到的东西 ，我们喜欢回答那些表现出能从答案中学习的人。\n运用某些策略，比如用谷歌（Google）搜索你遇到的各种错误提示（既搜索 谷歌论坛，也搜索网页）， 这样很可能直接就找到了解决问题的文档或邮件列表线索。 即使没有结果，在邮件列表或新闻组寻求帮助时提一句“我在谷歌中搜过下列句子但没有找到什么有用的东西” 也是件好事，至少它表明了搜索引擎不能提供哪些帮助。将搜索关键词与你的问题及可能的解决方案联系起来，还有助于引导其他有类似问题的人。\n别着急，不要指望几秒钟的谷歌搜索就能解决一个复杂的问题。读一下常见问题文档。在向专家提问之前，先向后靠靠放松一下，再思考一下问题。相信我们，他们能从你的提问看出你做了多少阅读与思考，如果你是有备而来，将更有可能得到解答。不要将所有问题一股脑抛出，只因你的第一次搜索没有结果（或者结果太多）。\n认真地思考，准备好你的问题。轻率的提问只能得到轻率的回答，或者压根没有。在提问时，你越是表现出在此前做过思考与努力去解决自己的问题，你越有可能得到真正的帮助。\n注意别提错问题。如果提问基于错误的假设，某黑客多半会一边想 “愚蠢的问题……”，一边按将错就错的答案回复你，并且希望这种只是得到你自己“问的问题”而非真正所需的解答，给你一个教训。\n永远不要假设你 有资格 得到解答。你没有这种资格，毕竟你没有为此服务付费。如果你能够提出有内容、有趣和激励思考的问题──那种毫无疑问能够向社区贡献经验，而不仅仅是消极地要求从别人那获取知识的问题，你将“挣到”答案。\n另一方面，表明你有能力也乐意参与问题的解决是个很好的开端。“有没有人能指个方向？”，我这还差点什么？”，“我应该查哪个网站？”，通常要比 “请给出我可以用的完整步骤”更容易得到回复，因为你表明了只要有人能指个方向，你就很乐意完成剩下的过程。\n提问时\n仔细挑选论坛\n要对在哪提问留心，如果你做了下述事情，多半会被一笔勾销或被看成“失败者”：\n张贴与论坛主题无关的问题\n在面向高级技术问题的论坛上张贴肤浅的问题，或者反之。\n在太多不同的新闻组同时张贴\n给既非熟人也没有义务解决你问题的人发送你私人的电邮\n为保护通信的渠道不被无关的东西淹没，黑客会除掉那些没有找对地方的问题，你不会想让这种事落到自己头上的。\n因此，第一步是找对论坛。谷歌和其它搜索引擎还是你的朋友，可以用它们搜索你遇到困难的软硬件问题最相关的项目网站。那里通常都有项目的常见问题（FAQ）、邮件列表及文档的链接。如果你的努力（包括 阅读 FAQ）都没有结果，这些邮件列表就是最后能取得帮助的地方。项目的网站也许还有报告Bug的流程或链接，如果是这样，去看看。\n向陌生的人或论坛发送邮件极有可能是在冒险。譬如，不要假设一个内容丰富的网页的作者想充当你的免费顾问，不要对你的问题是否会受到欢迎做太乐观的估计──如果你不确定，向别处发或者压根别发。\n在选择论坛、新闻组或邮件列表时，别太相信名字，先看看 FAQ 或者许可书以明确你的问题是否切题。发贴前先翻翻已有的帖子，这样可以让你感受一下那里行事的方式。事实上，张贴前在新闻组或邮件列表的历史文档中搜索与你问题相关的关键词是个极好的主意，也许就找到答案了。即使没有，也能帮助你归纳出更好的问题。\n别象机关枪似的一次性“扫射”所有的帮助渠道，这就象大喊大叫一样会令人不快，温柔地一个一个来。\n弄懂主题！最典型的错误之一是在某种致立于跨平台可移植的语言、库或工具的论坛中提关于 Unix 或 Windows 操作系统程序接口的问题。如果你不明白为什么这是大错，最好在搞清楚概念前什么也别问。\n一般来说，在仔细挑选的公共论坛中提问比在私有论坛中提同样的问题更容易得到有用的回答。有几个道理支持这点，一是看潜在的回复者有多少，二是看论坛的参与者有多少，黑客更愿回答能启发多数人的问题。\n可以理解，老练的黑客和一些流行软件的作者正在承受过多的不当消息。就象那根最后压垮骆驼背的稻草一样，你的加入也有可能使情况走向极端──已经好几次了，一些流行软件的作者退出了对自己软件的支持，因为伴随而来的涌入其私人邮箱的垃圾邮件变得无法忍受。\n面向新手的论坛和互联网中继聊天（IRC）通常响应最快\n本地的用户组织或者你所用的 Linux 发行版也许正在宣传新手取得帮助的论坛或 IRC 通道（在一些非英语国家，新手论坛很可能还是邮件列表），这些地方是开始提问的好去处，特别是当你觉得遇到的也许只是相对简单或者很普通的问题时。经过宣传的 IRC 通道是公开邀请提问的地方，通常可以得到实时的回复。\n事实上，如果出问题的程序来自某发行版（这很常见），最好先去该发行版的论坛或邮件列表中提问，再到程序本身的项目论坛或邮件列表，（否则）该项目的黑客可能仅仅回复“用 我们的 代码”。\n在任何论坛发贴以前，先看看有没有搜索功能。如果有，就试着用问题的几个关键词搜索一下，也许就有帮助。如果在此之前你已做过全面的网页搜索（你应该这样去做），还是再搜索一下论坛，搜索引擎有可能没来得及索引此论坛的全部内容。\n通过论坛或 IRC 通道提供项目的用户支持有增长的趋势，电子邮件交流则更多地为项目开发者保留。所以先在论坛或 IRC 中寻求与该项目相关的帮助。\n第二步，使用项目的邮件列表\n当某个项目存在开发者邮件列表时，要向列表而不是其中的个别成员提问，即使你确信能有最好地回答你的问题。查一查项目的文档和主页，找到项目的邮件列表并使用它。采用这种办法有几个很好的理由：\n向个别开发者提的问题（如果）足够好，也将对整个项目组有益。相反，如果你认为自己的问题对整个项目组来说太愚蠢，这也不能成为骚扰个别开发者的理由。\n向列表提问可以分散开发者的负担，个别开发者（尤其是项目领导）也许太忙以至于没法回答你的问题。\n大多数邮件列表都要存档，那些存档将被搜索引擎索引，如果你向列表提问并得到解答，将来其它人可以通过网页搜索找到你的问题和答案，也就不用再次发问了。\n如果某些问题经常被问到，开发者可以利用此信息改进文档或软件本身，以使其更清楚。如果只是私下提问，就没有人能看到最常见问题的完整场景。\n如果一个项目既有 “用户” 也有“开发者”（或 “黑客”）邮件列表或论坛，而你又不摆弄那些代码，向“用户”列表或论坛提问。不要假设自己会在开发者列表中受到欢迎，那些人多半会遭受你的噪音干扰。\n然尔，如果你 确信 你的问题不一般，而且在“用户” 列表或论坛中几天都没有回复，可以试试“开发者”列表或论坛。建议你在张贴前最好先暗暗地观察几天,至少看看最近几天保存的帖子,以了解那的行事方式（事实上这是参与任何私有或半私有列表的好主意）\n如果你找不到一个项目的邮件列表，而只能查到项目维护者的地址，只管向其发信。即便在这种情况下，也别假设（项目）邮件列表不存在。在你的电子邮件中陈述你已经试过但没有找到合适的邮件列表，也提及你不反对将自己的邮件转发给他人（许多人认为，即使没什么秘密，私人电子邮件也不应该被公开。通过允许将你的电子邮件转发他人，你给了相应人员处置你邮件的选择）。\n使用有意义且明确的主题\n在邮件列表、新闻组或论坛中，主题是你在五十个或更少的字以内吸引有资格专家注意的黄金机会，不要用诸如 “请帮我” （更别提大写的 “请帮我！！！！”，这种主题的消息会被条件反射式地删掉）之类的唠叨浪费机会。不要用你痛苦深度来感动我们，相反，要在这点空间中使用超级简明扼要的问题描述。\n使用主题的好惯例是“对象──偏差”（式的描述），许多技术支持组织就是这样做的。在“对象”部分指明是哪一个或哪一组东西有问题，在“偏差”部分则描述与期望的行为不一致的地方。\n愚蠢：\n救命啊！我的笔记本视频工作不正常！\n明智：\nX.org 6.8.1 扭曲鼠标光标，MV1005 型号的某显卡芯片组\n更明智：\n使用 MV1005 型号的某显卡芯片组在 X.org 6.8.1 的鼠标光标被扭曲\n编写 “对象──偏差”式描述的过程有助于你组织对问题的细致思考。是什么被影响了？仅仅是鼠标光标或者还有其它图形？只在 X.org 中出现？或只是在其 6.8.1 版中？是针对某显卡芯片组？或者只是其中的 MV1005 型号？一个黑客只需描一眼就能够立即明白什么是你遇到的问题，什么是你自己的问题。\n更一般地，想象一下在一个只显示主题的文档索引中查找。让你的主题更好地反映问题，可以使下一个搜索类似问题的人能够在文档中直接就找到答案的线索，而不用再次发贴提问。\n如果你想在回复中提问，确保改变主题以表明你是在问一个问题，一个主题象 Re: 测试 或者 Re: 新Bug 的消息不太可能引起足够的注意。同时，将回复中与新主题不甚相关的引用内容尽量删除。\n对于列表消息，不要直接点击回复（按钮）来开始一个全新的线索，这将限制你的观众。有些邮件阅读程序，比如 mutt，允许用户按线索排序并通过折叠线索来隐藏消息，这样做的人永远看不到你发的消息。\n仅仅改变主题还不够。mutt 和其它一些邮件阅读程序还要检查邮件头主题以外的其它信息，以便为其指定线索，所以宁可发一个全新的邮件。\n在论坛，因为消息与特定的线索紧密结合，并且通常在线索之外不可见，好的提问方式略有不同，通过回复提问并不要紧。不是所有论坛都允许在回复中出现分离的主题，而且这样做了基本上没有人会去看。不过，通过回复提问本身就是令人怀疑的做法，因为它们只会被正在查看该线索的人读到。所以，除非你 只想 在该线索当前活跃的人群中提问，还是另起炉灶比较好。\n使问题容易回复\n以请向……回复来结束问题多半会使你得不到回答。如果你觉得花几秒钟在邮件客户端设置一下回复地址都麻烦，我们也觉得花几秒钟考虑你的问题更麻烦。如果你的邮件客户端程序不支持这样做，换个好点的；如果是操作系统不支持所有这种邮件客户端程序，也换个好点的。\n在论坛，要求通过电子邮件回复是完全无礼的，除非你确信回复的信息也许是敏感的（而且有人会为了某些未知的原因，只让你而不是整个论坛知道答案）。如果你只是想在有人回复线索时得到电子邮件提醒，可以要求论坛发送。几乎所有论坛都支持诸如留意本线索、有回复发送邮件等功能。\n用清晰、语法、拼写正确的语句书写\n经验告诉我们，粗心与草率的作者通常也粗心与草率地思考和编程（我敢打赌）。为这些粗心与草率的思考者回答问题没有好处，我们宁可将时间花在其它地方。\n清楚、良好地表达你的问题非常重要。如果你觉得这样做麻烦，我们也觉得注意（你的问题）麻烦。花点额外的精力斟酌一下字句，用不着太僵硬与正式──事实上，黑客文化很看重能准确地使用非正式、俚语和幽默的语句。但它 必须 很准确，而且有迹象表明你是在思考和关注问题。\n正确地拼写、使用标点和大小写，不要将 its 混淆为 it's，loose 搞成 lose 或者将 “discrete” 弄成 “discreet”。不要全部用大写，这会被视为无礼的大声嚷嚷嚷 （全部小写也好不到哪去，因为不易阅读。Alan Cox [注：著名黑客，Linux 内核的重要参与者] 也许可以这样做，但你不行。）\n一般而言，如果你写得象个半文盲似的傻子，多半得不到理睬。也不要使用即时通讯中的简写，如将 you 简化为 u 会使你看起来象一个为了节约二次击键的半文盲式的傻子。更糟的是，如果象个小孩似地鬼画桃符那绝对是在找死，可以肯定没人会理你（或者最多是给你一大堆指责与挖苦）。\n如果在非母语论坛提问，你的拼写与语法错误会得到有限的宽容，但懒惰完全不会被容忍（是的，我们通常看得出其中的差别）。同时，除非你知道回复者使用的语言，请使用英语书写。繁忙的黑客一般会直接删除用他们看不懂语言写的消息。在互联网上英语是工作语言，用英语书写可以将你的问题不被阅读就被直接删除的可能性降到最低。\n如果你用英语书写但它是你的第二语言，最好提醒潜在的回复者语言上可能的困难以便绕过这个问题，比如：\n英语不是我的母语，请谅解拼写错误。\n如果您使用某某语言，请电邮/私聊我，也许我需要您的协助翻译我的问题。\n对于这个技术术语本身我很熟悉，但对于它的一些俚语或习惯表达方式就不太明白了。\n我已经同时用某某语及英语提问，如果您使用两者之一回复，我很乐意翻译。\n使用易于读取且标准的文件格式发送问题\n如果你人为地将问题搞得难以阅读，它多半会被忽略，人们更愿读易懂的问题，所以：\n使用纯文本而不是 HTML（超文本标注语言）（ 关闭HTML 并不难）\n使用 MIME（多用途互联网邮件扩展）附件通常没有问题，前提是真正有内容（譬如附带的源文件或补丁），而不仅仅是邮件客户端程序生成的模板（譬如只是消息内容的拷贝）。\n不要发送整段只是单行句子但多次折回的邮件（这使得回复部分内容非常困难）。设想你的读者是在80个字符宽的文本终端阅读邮件，设置你的行折回点小于 80 列。\n但是，也 不要 用任何固定列折回数据（譬如日志文件拷贝或会话记录）。数据应该原样包含，使回复者确信他们看到的是与你看到的一样的东西。\n在英语论坛中，不要使用’Quoted-Printable’ MIME 编码发送消息。这种编码对于张贴非 ASCII 语言可能是必须的，但很多邮件程序并不支持。当它们分断时，那些文本中四处散布的 “=20”符号既难看也分散注意力， even 有可能破坏内容的语意。\n永远不要 指望黑客们阅读使用封闭的专用格式编写的文档，诸如微软公司的 Word 或 Excel 文件等。大多数黑客对此的反应就象有人将还在冒热气的猪粪倒在你门口时你的反应一样。即使他们能够处理，也很厌恶这么做。\n如果你从使用视窗的电脑发送电子邮件，关闭问题颇多的微软“聪明引用”功能（在“工具” -&gt; “自动纠正选项”的“输入时自动格式化”下去掉聪明引用的选框），以免在你的邮件中到处散布垃圾字符。\n在论坛，勿滥用“表情符号”和“HTML”功能(当它们提供时)。一两个表情符号通常没有问题，但花哨的彩色文本倾向于使人认为你是个无能之辈。过滥地使用表情符号、色彩和字体会使你看来象个傻笑的小姑娘。这通常不是个好主意，除非你只是对性而不是有用的回复更有兴趣。\n如果你使用图形用户界面的邮件客户端程序(如网景公司的 Messenger、微软公司的 Outlook 或者其它类似的)，注意它们的缺省配置不一定满足这些要求。大多数这类程序有基于菜单的查看源码命令，用它来检查发送文件夹中的消息，以确保发送的是没有多余杂质的纯文本文件。\n描述问题应准确且有内容\n仔细、清楚地描述问题的症状\n描述问题发生的环境(主机、操作系统、应用程序，任何相关的)，提供销售商的发行版和版本号（如：“Fedora Core 7”、“Slackware 9.1”等）\n描述提问前做过的研究及其理解。\n描述提问前为确定问题而采取的诊断步骤。\n描述最近对计算机或软件配置的任何相关改变。\n如果可能，提供在可控环境下重现问题的方法。\n尽最大努力预测黑客会提到的问题，并提前备好答案。\n如果你认为是代码有问题，向黑客提供在可控环境下重现问题的方法尤其重要。当你这么做时，得到有用且及时回复的可能性将大大增加。\n西蒙.泰瑟姆（Simon Tatham）写过一篇《如何有效报告Bug》的文章，我强烈推荐各位阅读。\n量不在多，精炼则灵\n你应该（写得）精炼且有内容，简单地将一大堆代码或数据罗列在求助消息中达不到目的。如果你有一个很大且复杂的测试样例让程序崩溃，尝试将其裁剪得越小越好。\n至少有三个理由支持这点。第一，让别人看到你在努力简化问题使你更有可能得到回复。第二，简化问题使你更有可能得到 有用的 回复。第三，在提纯Bug报告的过程中，你可能自己就找到了解决办法或权宜之计。\n别急于宣称找到Bug\n当你在一个软件中遇到问题，除非你 非常、非常 的有根据，不要动辄声称找到了Bug。提示：除非我能提供解决问题的源代码补丁，或者对前一版本的回归测试表现出不正确的行为，否则你都多半不够完全确信。对于网页和文档也如此，如果你（声称）发现了文档的“Bug”，你应该能提供相应位置的替代文本。\n记住，还有许多其它用户并未经历你遇到的问题，否则你在阅读文档或搜索网页时就应该发现了（你在报怨前已经做了这些，是吧 ？）。这也意味着很有可能是你弄错了而不是软件本身有问题。\n编写软件的人总是非常辛苦地使它尽可能完美。如果你声称找到了Bug，也就置疑了他们的能力，即使你是对的，也有可能会使其中的部分人感到不快。（此外，）在主题中嚷嚷“Bug”也是特别不老练的。\n提问时，即使你私下非常确信已经发现一个真正的Bug，最好写得象是 你 做错了什么。如果真的有Bug，你会在回复中看到这点。这样做的话，如果真有虫子，维护者就会向你道歉，这总比你弄砸了然后欠别人一个道歉要强。\n低声下气代替不了做自己的家庭作业\n有些人明白他们不应该粗鲁或傲慢地行事并要求得到答复，但他们退到相反的低声下气的极端：“我知道我只是个可怜的新丁，一个失败者，但……”。这既使人困扰，也没有用，当伴随着对实际问题含糊的描述时还特别令人反感。\n别用低级灵长类动物的办法浪费你我的时间，相反，尽可能清楚地描述背景情况和你的问题，这比低声下气更好地摆正了你的位置。\n有时，论坛设有单独的初学者提问版面，如果你真的认为遇到了肤浅的问题，到那去就是了，但一样别低声下气。\n描述问题症状而不是猜测\n告诉黑客是什么导致了问题是没用的（如果你的诊断理论是了不起的东西，你还会向别人咨询求助吗？）。所以，确保只是告诉他们问题的原始症状，而不是你的解释和理论，让他们来解释和诊断。如果你认为陈述自己的猜测很重要，应清楚地说明这只是你的猜测并描述为什么它们不起作用。\n愚蠢：\n我在编译内核时接连遇到 SIG11 错误，怀疑主板上的某根电路丝断了，找到它们的最好办法是什么？\n明智：\n我组装的电脑（K6/233 CPU、FIC-PA2007 主板[威盛 Apollo VP2 芯片组]、Corsair PC133 SDRAM 256Mb 内存）最近在开机 20 分钟左右、做内核编译时频繁地报 SIG11 错，但在头 20 分钟内从不出问题。重启动不会复位时钟，但整夜关机会。更换所有内存未解决问题，相关的典型编译会话日志附后。\n由于以上这点许多人似乎难以掌握，这里有句话可以提醒你：“所有的诊断专家都来自密苏里州”。美国国务院的官方座右铭则是“让我看看”（出自国会议员威勒德.D.范迪弗［Willard D. Vandiver］在1899年时的讲话：“我来自一个出产玉米、棉花、牛蒡和民主党人的国家，滔滔雄辩既不能说服我，也不会让我满意。我来自密苏里州，你必须让我看看。”）针对诊断者而言，这并不是怀疑，而只是一种真实而有用的需求，以便让学生看到与你看到的原始证据尽可能一致的东西，而不是你的猜测与总结。（所以，）让我们看看。\n按时间先后罗列问题症状\n刚出问题之前发生的事情通常包含有解决问题最有效的线索。所以，记录中应准确地描述你、电脑和软件在崩溃前都做了什么。在命令行处理的情况下，有会话日志（如运行脚本工具生成的）并引用相关的若干（如20）行记录会非常有帮助。\n如果崩溃的程序有诊断选项（如-v详述开关），试着选择这些能在记录中增加排错信息的选项。记住，“多”不等于“好”。试着选取适当的排错级别以便提供有用的信息而不是将阅读者淹没在垃圾中。\n如果你的记录很长（如超过四段），在开头简述问题随后按时间先后罗列详细过程也许更有用。这样，黑客在读你的记录时就知道该注意哪些内容了。\n描述目标而不是过程\n如果你想弄清楚如何做某事（而不是报告一个Bug），在开头就描述你的目标，然后才陈述遇到问题的特定步骤。\n经常出现这种情况，寻求技术帮助的人在脑袋里有个更高层次的目标，他们在自以为能达到目标的特定道路上被卡住了，然后跑来问该怎么走，但没有意识到这条路本身有问题，结果要费很大的劲才能通过。\n愚蠢：\n我怎样才能让某图形程序的颜色拾取器取得十六进制的 RGB 值？\n明智：\n我正试着用自己选定数值的颜色替换一幅图片的色表，我现在知道的唯一方法是编辑每个表槽，但却无法让某图形程序的颜色拾取器取得十六进制的 RGB 值。\n第二种提法是明智的，它使得建议采用更合适的工具以完成任务的回复成为可能。\n别要求私下回复电邮\n黑客们认为问题的解决过程应该公开、透明，此过程中如果更有才能的人注意到不完整或者不当之处，最初的回复才能够、也应该被纠正。同时，作为回复者也因为能力和学识被其它同行看到而得到某种回报。\n当你要求私下回复时，此过程和回报都被中止。别这样做，让 回复者 来决定是否私下回答──如果他真这么做了，通常是因为他认为问题编写太差或者太肤浅，以至于对其它人毫无意义。\n对这条规则存在一条有限的例外，如果你确信提问可能会引来大量雷同的回复时，那么“向我发电邮，我将为论坛归纳这些回复”将是神奇的句子。试着将邮件列表或新闻组从洪水般雷同的回复中解救出来是非常有礼貌的──但你必须信守诺言。\n提问应明确\n漫无边际的问题通常也被视为没有明确限制的时间无底洞。最有可能给你有用答案的人通常也是最忙的人（假如只是因为他们承担了太多工作的话），这些人对于没有止境的时间无底洞极其敏感，所以他们也倾向于讨厌那些漫无边际的问题。\n如果你明确了想让回复者做的事（如指点方向、发送代码、检查补丁或其它），你更有可能得到有用的回复。（因为）这样可以让学生集中精力并间接地设定了他们为帮助你需要花费的时间和精力上限，这很好。\n要想理解专家生活的世界，可以这样设想：那里有丰富的专长资源但稀缺的响应时间。你暗中要求他们奉献的时间越少，你越有可能从这些真正懂行也真正很忙的专家那里得到解答。\n所以限定你的问题以使专家回答时需要付出的时间最少──这通常与简化问题还不太一样。举个例，“请问可否指点一下哪有好一点的 X 解释？”通常要比“请解释一下 X”明智。如果你的代码不运行了，通常请别人看看哪有问题比叫他们帮你改正更明智。\n关于代码的问题\n别要求他人给你出问题的代码排错而不提及应该从何入手。张贴几百行的代码，然后说一声“它不能运行”会让你得不到理睬。只贴几十行代码，然后说一句“在第七行以后，本应该显示，但实际出现的是”非常有可能让你得到回复。\n最精确描述代码问题的方法是提供一个能展示问题的最小测试样例。什么是最小测试样例？它是对问题的展现，只需要刚好能够重现非预期行为的代码即可。如何生成一个最小测试样例？如果你知道哪一行或哪一段代码会产生问题，将其复制并提供刚好够用的外围支撑代码以构成一个完整的样例（够用是指源码刚好能被编译器、解释器或任何处理它的程序所接受）。如果你不能将问题缩小到特定的段落，复制源码并去除那些与问题无关的代码段。你能提供的最小测试样例越小越好（参见 量不在多，精炼则灵 ）。\n生成一个非常小的最小测试样例并不总是可能，但尽力去做是很好的锻练，这有可能帮助你找到需要自己解决的问题。即使你找不到，黑客们喜欢看到你努力过，这将使他们更合作。\n如果你只是想让别人帮忙审一下代码，在最开头就要说出来，并且一定要提到你认为哪一部分特别需要关注以及为什么。\n别张贴家庭作业式问题\n黑客们善于发现“家庭作业”式的问题。我们中的大多数人已经做了自己的家庭作业，那是该 你 做的，以便从中学到东西。问一下提示没有关系，但不是要求完整的解决方案。\n如果你怀疑自己碰到了一个家庭作业式的问题，但仍然无法解决，试试在用户组、论坛或（作为最后一招）在项目的“用户”邮件列表或论坛中提问。尽管黑客们会看出来，一些老用户也许仍会给你提示。\n删除无意义的要求\n抵制这种诱惑，即在求助消息末尾加上诸如“有人能帮我吗？”或“有没有答案？”之类在语义上毫无意义的东西。第一，如果问题描述还不完整，这些附加的东西最多也只能是多余的。第二，因为它们是多余的，黑客们会认为这些东西烦人──就很有可能用逻辑上无误但打发人的回复，诸如“是的，你可以得到帮助”和“不，没有给你的帮助”。\n一般来说，避免提“是或否”类型的问题，除非你想得到 “是或否”类型的回答。\n不要把问题标记为“紧急”，即使对你而言的确如此\n这是你的问题，不要我们的。宣称“紧急”极有可能事与愿违：大多数黑客会直接删除这种消息，他们认为这是无礼和自私地企图得到即时与特殊的关照。而且“紧急”或其它有类似含义的主题有可能触发垃圾过滤规则，潜在的回复者可能永远看不到你的问题！\n有一点点局部的例外，如果你是在一些知名度很高、会使黑客们激动的地方使用程序，也许值得这样去做。在这种情况下，如果你有期限压力，也很有礼貌地提到这点，人们也许会有足够的兴趣快一点回答。\n当然，这是非常冒险的，因为黑客们对什么是令人激动的标准多半与你的不同。譬如从国际空间站这样张贴没有问题，但代表感觉良好的慈善或政治原因这样做几乎肯定不行。事实上，张贴诸如“紧急：帮我救救这个毛绒绒的小海豹！”肯定会被黑客回避或光火，即使他们认为毛绒绒的小海豹很重要。\n如果你觉得这不可思议，再把剩下的内容多读几遍，直到弄懂了再发贴也不迟。\n礼貌总是有益的\n礼貌一点，使用 请 和 谢谢你的关注 或者 谢谢你的关照，让别人明白你感谢他们无偿花时间帮助你。\n坦率地讲，这一点没有语法正确、文字清晰、准确、有内容和避免使用专用格式重要（同时也不能替代它们）。黑客们一般宁可读有点唐突但技术鲜明的Bug报告，而不是那种有礼但含糊的报告。（如果这点让你不解，记住我们是按问题能教我们什么来评价它的）\n然尔，如果你已经谈清楚了技术问题，客气一点肯定会增加你得到有用回复的机会。\n（我们必须指出，本文唯一受到一些老黑客认真反对的地方是以前曾经推荐过的“提前谢了”，一些黑客认为这隐含着事后不用再感谢任何人的暗示。我们的建议是要么先说 提前谢了，事后再 对回复者表示感谢，要么换种方式表达，譬如用 谢谢你的关注 或 谢谢你的关照）。\n问题解决后追加一条简要说明\n问题解决后向所有帮助过的人追加一条消息，让他们知道问题是如何解决的并再次感谢。如果问题在邮件列表或新闻组中受到广泛关注，在那里追加此消息比较恰当。\n最理想的方式是向最初提问的线索回复此消息，并在主题中包含 已解决、已搞定 或其它同等含义的明显标记。人在人往的邮件列表里，一个看见线索 问题 X 和 问题 X-已解决 的潜在回复者就明白不用再浪费时间了（除非他个人觉得“问题 X”有趣），因此可以利用此时间去解决其它问题。\n追加的消息用不着太长或太复杂，一句简单的“你好──是网线坏了！谢谢大家──比尔”就比什么都没有要强。事实上，除非解决问题的技术真正高深，一条简短而亲切的总结比长篇大论要好。说明是什么行动解决了问题，用不着重演整个排错的故事。\n对于有深度的问题，张贴排错历史的摘要是恰当的。描述问题的最终状态，说明是什么解决了问题，在此之后 才指明可以避免的弯路。应避免的弯路部分应放在正确的解决方案和其它总结材料之后，而不要将此消息搞成侦探推理小说。列出那些帮助过你的名字，那样你会交到朋友的。\n除了有礼貌、有内容以外，这种类型的追帖将帮助其他人在邮件列表、新闻组或论坛文档中搜索到真正解决你问题的方案，从而也让他们受益。\n最后，此类追帖还让每位参与协助的人因问题的解决而产生一种满足感。如果你自己不是技术专家或黑客，相信我们，这种感觉对于你寻求帮助的老手和专家是非常重要的。问题叙述到最后不知所终总是令人沮丧的，黑客们痒痒地渴望它们被解决。挠痒痒 为你挣到的信誉将对你下次再次张贴提问非常非常的有帮助。\n考虑一下怎样才能避免他人将来也遇到类似的问题，问问自己编一份文档或 FAQ 补丁会不会有帮助，如果是的话就将补丁发给维护者。\n在黑客中，这种良好的后继行动实际上比传统的礼貌更重要，也是你善待他人而赢得声誉的方式，这是非常有价值的财富。\n如何解读回答\n“读读该死的手册”（RTFM）和“搜搜该死的网络”（STFW）：如何明白你已完全搞砸\n有一个古老而神圣的传统：如果你收到 读读该死的手册（RTFM） 的回复，发信人认为你应该去“读读该死的手册”。他或她多半是对的，去读一下吧。\n“读读该死的手册”（RTFM）有个年轻一点的亲戚，如果你收到“搜搜该死的网络”（STFW）的回复，发信人认为你应该“搜搜该死的网络”。那人多半也是对的，去搜一下吧。(更温和一点的说法是“谷歌是你的朋友！”)\n在论坛，你也可能被要求去搜索论坛的文档。事实上，有人甚至可能热心地为你提供以前解决此问题的线索。但不要依赖这种关照，提问前应该先搜索一下文档。\n通常，叫你搜索的人已经打开了能解决你问题的手册或网页，正在一边看一边敲键盘。这些回复意味着他认为：\n第一，你要的信息很容易找到。\n第二，自已找要比别人喂到嘴里能学得更多。\n你不应该觉得这样就被冒犯了，按黑客的标准，回复者没有不理你就是在向你表示某种尊敬，你反而应该感谢他热切地想帮助你。\n如果还不明白……\n如果你看不懂回答，不要马上回复一个要求说明的消息，先试试那些最初提问时用过的相同工具（如手册、FAQ、网页、懂行的朋友等）试着搞懂回答。如果还是需要说明，展现你已经明白的。\n譬如，假如我告诉你：“看起来象是某输入项有问题，你需要清除它”，接着是个 不好 的回帖：“什么是某输入项？”。而这是一个 很好 的跟帖：“是的，我读了手册，某某输入项只在 -z 和 -p 开关中被提到，但都没有涉及到如何清除它们，你指的是哪一个还是我弄错了什么？”\n对待无礼\n很多黑客圈子中看似无礼的行为并不是存心冒犯。相反，它是直接了当、一针见血式的交流风格，这种风格对于更关注解决问题而不是使别人感觉舒服而混乱的人是很自然的。\n如果你觉得被冒犯了，试着平静地反应。如果有人真的做了过格的事，邮件列表、新闻组或论坛中的前辈多半会招呼他。如果这 没有 发生而你却光火了，那么你发火对象的言语可能在黑客社区中看起来是正常的，而 你 将被视为有错的一方，这将伤害到你获取信息或帮助的机会。\n另一方面，你会偶而真的碰到无礼和无聊的言行。与上述相反，对真正的冒犯者狠狠地打击、用犀利的语言将其驳得体无完肤都是可以接受的。然尔，在行事之前一定要非常非常的有根据。纠正无礼的言论与开始一场毫无意义的口水战仅一线之隔，黑客们自己莽撞地越线的情况并不鲜见。如果你是新手或外来者，避开这种莽撞的机会并不高。如果你想得到的是信息而不是消磨时光，这时最好不要把手放在键盘上以免冒险。\n（有些人断言很多黑客都有轻度的自闭症或阿斯伯格综合症，缺少用于润滑人类社会“正常”交往所需的脑电路。这既可能是真也可能是假。如果你自己不是黑客，兴许你认为我们脑袋有问题还能帮助你应付我们的古怪行为。只管这么干好了，我们不在乎。我们 喜欢 现在这个样子，并且一般都对病号标记有站得住脚的怀疑。）\n在下一节，我们会谈到另一个问题，当 你 行为不当时会受到的“冒犯”。\n别象失败者那样反应\n在黑客社区的论坛中有那么几次你可能会搞砸──以本文描述或类似的方式。你会被示众是如何搞砸的，也许言语中还会带点颜色。\n这种事发生以后，我们能做的最糟糕的事莫过于哀嚎你的遭遇、宣称被口头攻击、要求道歉、高声尖叫、憋闷气、威胁诉诸法律、向其雇主报怨、忘了关马桶盖等等。相反，你该这样去做：\n熬过去，这很正常。事实上，它是有益健康与恰当的。\n社区的标准不会自己维持，它们是通过参与者积极而 公开 地执行来维持的。不要哭嚎所有的批评都应该通过私下的邮件传送，这不是事情运作的方式。当有人评论你的一个说法有误或者提出不同看法时，坚持声称受到个人攻击也毫无益处，这些都是失败者的态度。\n也有其它的黑客论坛，受过高礼节要求的误导，禁止参与者张贴任何对别人帖子挑毛病的消息，并声称“如果你不想帮助用户就闭嘴”。有思路的参与者纷纷离开的结果只会使它们变成了毫无意义的唠叨与无用的技术论坛。\n是夸张的“友谊”（以上述方式）还是有用？挑一个。\n记着：当黑客说你搞砸了，并且(无论多么刺耳地)告诉你别再这样做时，他正在为关心你和他的社区而行动。对他而言，不理你并将你从他的生活中滤除要容易得多。如果你无法做到感谢，至少要有点尊严，别大声哀嚎，也别因为自己是个有戏剧性超级敏感的灵魂和自以为有资格的新来者，就指望别人象对待脆弱的洋娃娃那样对你。\n有时候，即使你没有搞砸（或者只是别人想象你搞砸了）， 有些人也会无缘无故地攻击你本人。在这种情况下，报怨倒是 真的 会把问题搞砸。\n这些找茬者要么是毫无办法但自以为是专家的不中用家伙，要么就是测试你是否真会搞砸的心理专家。其它读者要么不理睬，要么用自己的方式对付他们。这些找茬者在给自己找麻烦，这点你不用操心。\n也别让自己卷入口水战，大多数口水战最好不要理睬──当然，是在你核实它们只是口水战、没有指出你搞砸的地方，而且没有巧妙地将问题真正的答案藏于其中之后（这也是可能的）。\n提问禁忌\n下面是些典型的愚蠢问题和黑客不回答它们时的想法。\n问：我到哪可以找到某程序或 X 资源？\n问：我怎样用 X 做 Y？\n问：如何配置我的 shell 提示？\n问：我可以用 Bass-o-matic 文件转换工具将 AcmeCorp 文档转为 TeX 格式吗？\n问：我的{程序、配置、SQL 语句}不运行了\n问：我的视窗电脑出问题了，你能帮忙吗？\n问：我的程序不运行了，我认为系统工具X有问题\n问：我安装 Linux 或 X 遇到困难，我能帮忙吗？\n问：我如何才能破解超级用户口令/盗取通道操作员的特权/查看某人的电子邮件？\n问：\n我到哪可以找到某程序或 X 资源？\n答：\n在我找到它的同样地方，笨旦──在网页搜索引擎上。上帝啊，难道还有人不知道如何使用 谷歌 吗？\n问：\n我怎样用 X 做 Y？\n答：\n如果你想解决的是 Y，提问时别给出可能并不恰当的方法。这种问题说明提问者不但对 X 完全无知，也对要解决的 Y 问题糊涂，还被特定形势禁锢了思维。等他们把问题弄好再说。\n问：\n如何配置我的 shell 提示？\n答：\n如果你有足够的智慧提这个问题，你也该有足够的智慧去 “读读该死的手册”（RTFM），然后自己去找出来。\n问：\n我可以用 Bass-o-matic 文件转换工具将 AcmeCorp 文档转为 TeX 格式吗？\n答：\n试试就知道了。如果你试过，你既知道了答案，又不用浪费我的时间了。\n问：\n我的{程序、配置、SQL 语句}不运行了\n答：\n这不是一个问题，我也没有兴趣去猜你有什么问题──我有更要紧的事要做。看到这种东西，我的反应一般如下：\n你还有什么补充吗？\n噢，太糟了，希望你能搞定。\n这跟我究竟有什么关系？\n问：\n我的视窗电脑出问题了，我能帮忙吗？\n答：\n是的，把视窗垃圾删了，装个象 Linux 或 BSD 的开源操作系统吧。\n注意：如果程序有官方的视窗版或者与视窗有交互(如 Samba)，你 可以 问与视窗相关的问题，只是别对问题是由视窗操作系统而不是程序本身造成的回复感到惊讶，因为视窗一般来说太差，这种说法一般都成立。\n问：\n我的程序不运行了，我认为系统工具 X 有问题\n答：\n你完全有可能是第一个注意到被成千上万用户反复使用的系统调用与库文件有明显缺陷的人，更有可能的是你完全没有根据。不同凡响的说法需要不同凡响的证据，当你这样声称时，你必须有清楚而详尽的缺陷说明文档作后盾。\n问：\n我安装 Linux 或 X 遇到困难，我能帮忙吗？\n答：\n不行，我需要亲手操作你的电脑才能帮你排错，去向当地的 Linux 用户组寻求方便的帮助（你可以在 这里 找到用户组列表）\n注意：如果安装问题与某 Linux 发行版有关，在针对 它 的邮件列表、论坛或本地用户组织中提问也许是恰当的。此时，应描述问题的准确细节。在此之前，先用 “linux”和 所有 被怀疑的硬件 [作关键词] 仔细搜索。\n问：\n我如何才能破解超级用户口令/盗取通道操作员的特权/查看某人的电子邮件？\n答：\n想做这种事情说明你是个卑劣的家伙，想让黑客教你做这种事情说明你是个白痴。\n好问题与坏问题\n最后，我将通过举例来演示提问的智慧。同样的问题两种提法，一种愚蠢，另一种明智。\n愚蠢：我在哪能找到关于 Foonly Flurbamatic 设备的东西？\n这个问题在乞求得到 “搜搜该死的网络”（STFW） 式的回复。\n明智： 我用谷歌搜索过“Foonly Flurbamatic 2600”，但没有找到什么有用的，有谁知道在哪能找到这种设备的编程信息？\n这个人已经搜索过网络了，而且听起来他可能真的遇到了问题。\n愚蠢： 我不能编译某项目的源代码，它为什么这么破？\n提问者假设是别人搞砸了，太自大了。\n明智： 某项目的源代码不能在某 Linux 6.2 版下编译。我读了常见问题文档，但其中没有与某 Linux 相关的内容。这是编译时的记录，我做错了什么吗？\n提问者已经指明了运行环境，读了常见问题文档（FAQ），列出了错误，也没有假设问题是别人的过错，这家伙值得注意。\n愚蠢： 我的主板有问题，谁能帮我？\n某黑客对此的反应可能是：“是的，还需要帮你拍背和换尿布吗？”，然后是敲下删除键。\n明智： 我在 S2464 主板上试过 X、Y 和 Z，当它们都失败后，又试了 A、B 和 C。注意我试 C 时的奇怪症状，显然某某东西正在做某某事情，这不是期望的行为。通常在 Athlon MP 主板上导致某某事情的原因是什么？有谁知道我还能再试点什么以确定问题？\n相反地，这个人看来值得回答。他或她展现了解决问题的能力而不是坐等天上掉馅饼。\n在最后那个问题中，注意“给我一个回答”与“请帮我看看我还能再做点什么测试以得到启发”之间细微但重要的差别。\n事实上，最后那个问题基本上源于 2001 年 8 月 Linux 内核邮件列表（lkml）上的真实事件，是我（Eric）当时提了那个问题，我发现 Tyan S2462 主板有神秘的死机现象，邮件列表成员给我提供了解决此问题的关键信息。\n通过这种提问方式，我给了别人可以咀嚼玩味的东西。我设法使之对参与者既轻松又有吸引力，也表明了对同行能力的尊敬并邀请他们与我一起协商。通过告诉他们我已经走过的弯路，我还表明了对他们宝贵时间的尊重。\n事后，当我感谢大家并评论这次良好的经历时，一个 Linux 内核邮件列表的成员谈到，他认为我得到答案并不是因为我的名字挂在列表上，而只是因为我正确的提问方式。\n黑客们在某种方面是非常不留情面的精英分子。我想在这事上他是对的，如果我 表现得 象个不劳而获的寄生虫，不管我是谁都会被忽略或斥责。他建议将整个事件作为对其它人提问的指导，这直接导致了本文的编写。\n如果得不到回答\n如果得不到回答，请不要认为我们不想帮你，有时只是因为被问到的小组成员的确不知道答案。没有回复不等于不被理睬，当然必须承认从外面很难看出两者的差别。\n一般而言，直接将问题再张贴一次不好，这会被视为毫无意义的骚扰。耐心一点，知道你问题答案的人可能生活在不同的时区，有可能正在睡觉，也有可能你的问题一开始就没有组织好。\n还有其它资源可以寻求帮助，通常是在一些面向新手的资源中。\n有许多在线与本地的用户组织，虽然它们自己不编写任何软件，但是对软件很热心。这些用户组通常因互助和帮助新手而形成。\n还有众多大小商业公司提供签约支持服务，别因为要付点钱才有支持就感到沮丧！毕竟，如果你车子的汽缸垫烧了，你多半还得花钱找个修理店把它弄好。即使软件没花你一分钱，你总不能指望服务支持都是免费的。\n象 Linux 这样流行的软件，每个开发者至少有一万个以上的用户，一个人不可能应付这么多用户的服务要求。记住，即使你必须付费才能得到支持，也比你还得额外花钱买软件要少得多（而且对封闭源代码软件的服务支持与开源软件相比通常还要贵一点，也要差一点）。\n如何更好地回答\n态度和善一点。问题带来的压力常使人显得无礼或愚蠢，其实并不是这样。\n对初犯者私下回复。 对那些坦诚犯错之人没有必要当众羞辱，一个真正的新手也许连怎么搜索或在哪找 FAQ 都不知道。\n如果你不确定，一定要说出来！ 一个听起来权威的错误回复比没有还要糟，别因为听起来象个专家好玩就给别人乱指路。要谦虚和诚实，给提问者与同行都树个好榜样。\n如果帮不了忙，别妨碍。 不要在具体步骤上开玩笑，那样也许会毁了用户的安装──有些可怜的呆瓜会把它当成真的指令。\n探索性的反问以引出更多的细节。 如果你做得好，提问者可以学到点东西──你也可以。试试将很差的问题转变成好问题，别忘了我们都曾是新手。\n尽管对那些懒虫报怨一声“读读该死的手册”（RTFM）是正当的，指出文档的位置（即使只是建议做个谷歌关键词搜索）会更好\n如果你决意回答，给出好的答案。 当别人正在用错误的工具或方法时别建议笨拙的权宜之计，应推荐更好的工具，重新组织问题。\n请回答真正的问题！如果提问者已经做了自己该做的研究，并且说明尝试过 X，Y，Z，A，B 与 C 都没有得到想要的結果，那么回复 试试 A 或 B 或者给出一个内容为 试一下 X，Y，Z，A，B 或 C 的链接将极其无益！\n帮助你的社区从中学习。当回复一个好问题时，问问自己 如何修改相关文件或 FAQ 文档以免再次解答同样的问题？，接着再向文档维护者发一份补丁。\n如果你是在研究一番后才做出的回答，展现你的技巧而不是直接端出结果。毕竟“授人以鱼，不如授人以渔”。\n相关资源\n如果需要个人电脑、Unix 和互联网如何工作的基础知识，参阅 Unix 和互联网工作的基本原理。\n当你发布软件或补丁时，试着按 软件发布实践 操作。\n鸣谢\n伊夫林.米切尔（Evelyn

Way"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/iptables-tour/":{"body":"iptables 规则表和链\niptables介绍\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;netfilter/iptables（简称为iptables）组成Linux平台下的包过滤防火墙，与大多数的Linux软件一样，这个包过滤防火墙是免费的，它可以代替昂贵的商业防火墙解决方案，完成封包过滤、封包重定向和网络地址转换（NAT）等功能。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;规则（rules）其实就是网络管理员预定义的条件，规则一般的定义为“如果数据包头符合这样的条件，就这样处理这个数据包”。规则存储在内核空间的信息 包过滤表中，这些规则分别指定了源地址、目的地址、传输协议（如TCP、UDP、ICMP）和服务类型（如HTTP、FTP和SMTP）等。当数据包与规 则匹配时，iptables就根据规则所定义的方法来处理这些数据包，如放行（accept）、拒绝（reject）和丢弃（drop）等。配置防火墙的 主要工作就是添加、修改和删除这些规则。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iptables和netfilter的关系是一个很容易让人搞不清的问题。很多的知道iptables却不知道netfilter。其实iptables只是Linux防火墙的管理工具而已，位于/sbin/iptables。真正实现防火墙功能的是netfilter，它是Linux内核中实现包过滤的内部结构。\niptables传输数据包的过程\n当一个数据包进入网卡时，它首先进入PREROUTING链，内核根据数据包目的IP判断是否需要转送出去。\n如果数据包就是进入本机的，它就会沿着图向下移动，到达INPUT链。数据包到了INPUT链后，任何进程都会收到它。本机上运行的程序可以发送数据包，这些数据包会经过OUTPUT链，然后到达POSTROUTING链输出。\n如果数据包是要转发出去的，且内核允许转发，数据包就会如图所示向右移动，经过FORWARD链，然后到达POSTROUTING链输出。\niptables规则表和链\n表（tables）提供特定的功能，iptables内置了4个表，即filter表、nat表、mangle表和raw表，分别用于实现包过滤，网络地址转换、包重构(修改)和数据跟踪处理。\n链（chains）是数据包传播的路径，每一条链其实就是众多规则中的一个检查清单，每一条链中可以有一 条或数条规则。当一个数据包到达一个链时，iptables就会从链中第一条规则开始检查，看该数据包是否满足规则所定义的条件。如果满足，系统就会根据 该条规则所定义的方法处理该数据包；否则iptables将继续检查下一条规则，如果该数据包不符合链中任一条规则，iptables就会根据该链预先定 义的默认策略来处理数据包。\nIptables采用“表”和“链”的分层结构。在REHL4中是三张表五个链。现在REHL5成了四张表五个链了，不过多出来的那个表用的也不太多，所以基本还是和以前一样。下面罗列一下这四张表和五个链。注意一定要明白这些表和链的关系及作用。\n规则表\nFilter 表：（作用链：INPUT、FORWARD、OUTPUT）用于过滤数据包，内核模块 net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_filter.c；\nNat 表：（作用链：PREROUTING、POSTROUTING、OUTPUT）用于网络地址转换（IP、端口），内核模块 net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_nat.c；\nMangle 表：（作用链：PREROUTING、POSTROUTING、INPUT、OUTPUT、FORWARD , 即作用于全部链），修改数据包的服务类型、TTL、并且可以配置路由实现QOS内核模块，内核模块 net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_mangle.c；\nRaw 表：（作用链：OUTPUT、PREROUTING），决定数据包是否被状态跟踪机制处理，内核模块：net/ipv4/netfilter/iptable_raw.c\nRaw表REHL4没有，常用的是Filter/Nat；\n规则链\nINPUT：进来的数据包应用此规则链中的策略\nOUTPUT：外出的数据包应用此规则链中的策略\nFORWARD：转发数据包时应用此规则链中的策略\nPREROUTING：对数据包作路由选择前应用此链中的策略，所有的数据包进来的时侯都先由这个链处理\nPOSTROUTING：对数据包作路由选择后应用此链中的策略，所有的数据包出来的时侯都先由这个链处理\n规则链顺序：Raw –&gt; Mangle –&gt; Nat –&gt; Filter\n入站数据流向：\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;从外界到达防火墙的数据包，先被PREROUTING规则链处理（是否修改数据包地址等），之后会进行路由选择（判断该数据包应该发往何处），如果数据包的目标主机是防火墙本机（比如说Internet用户访问防火墙主机中的web服务器的数据包），那么内核将其传给INPUT链进行处理（决定是否允许通过等），通过以后再交给系统上层的应用程序（比如Apache服务器）进行响应。\n转发数据流方向：\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;来自外界的数据包到达防火墙后，首先被PREROUTING规则链处理，之后会进行路由选择，如果数据包的目标地址是其它外部地址（比如局域网用户通过网关访问QQ站点的数据包），则内核将其传递给FORWARD链进行处理（是否转发或拦截），然后再交给POSTROUTING规则链（是否修改数据包的地址等）进行处理。\n出站数据流向：\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;防火墙本机向外部地址发送的数据包（比如在防火墙主机中测试公网DNS服务器时），首先被OUTPUT规则链处理，之后进行路由选择，然后传递给POSTROUTING规则链（是否修改数据包的地址等）进行处理。\n管理和设置iptables规则\niptables的基本用法：iptables [-t 表名] 命令选项 ［链名］ ［条件匹配］ ［-j 目标动作或跳转］\n表名、链名用于指定iptables命令所操作的表和链，命令选项用于指定管理iptables规则的方式（比如：插入、增加、删除、查看等；条件匹配用于指定对符合什么样 条件的数据包进行处理；目标动作或跳转用于指定数据包的处理方式（比如允许通过、拒绝、丢弃、跳转（Jump）给其它链处理。\n命令选项：\n-A 在指定链的末尾添加（append）一条新的规则\n-D 删除（delete）指定链中的某一条规则，可以按规则序号和内容删除\n-I 在指定链中插入（insert）一条新的规则，默认在第一行添加\n-R 修改、替换（replace）指定链中的某一条规则，可以按规则序号和内容替换\n-L 列出（list）指定链中所有的规则进行查看\n-E 重命名用户定义的链，不改变链本身\n-F 清空（flush）\n-N 新建（new-chain）一条用户自己定义的规则链\n-X 删除指定表中用户自定义的规则链（delete-chain）\n-P 设置指定链的默认策略（policy）\n-Z 将所有表的所有链的字节和数据包计数器清零\n-n 使用数字形式（numeric）显示输出结果\n-v 查看规则表详细信息（verbose）的信息\n-V 查看版本(version)\n-h 获取帮助（help）\n数据包处理方式：\nACCEPT 允许数据包通过\nDROP 直接丢弃数据包，不给任何回应信息\nREJECT 拒绝数据包通过，必要时会给数据发送端一个响应的信息\nLOG在/var/log/messages文件中记录日志信息，然后将数据包传递给下一条规则\niptables防火墙规则的保存和恢复：\niptables-save把规则保存到文件中，再由目录rc.d下的脚本（/etc/rc.d/init.d/iptables）自动装载\n使用命令iptables-save来保存规则。一般用\niptables-save &gt; /etc/sysconfig/iptables\n生成保存规则的文件 /etc/sysconfig/iptables，\n也可以用\nservice iptables save\n它能把规则自动保存在/etc/sysconfig/iptables中。\n当计算机启动时，rc.d下的脚本将用命令iptables-restore调用这个文件，从而就自动恢复了规则\n常见实用案例\nmangle 表\n介绍\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mangle 表是 iptables 中用于修改数据包的标记的表，它可以在数据包经过路由表之前，根据规则修改数据包的IP头部的一些字段，如 TTL 值、TOS 值等。这样可以影响数据包在网络中的转发方式和处理方式。mangle 表包含五个链：PREROUTING、POSTROUTING、INPUT、OUTPUT 和 FORWARD。mangle 表的优先级仅次于 raw 表，它会在 nat 表和 filter 表之前执行。\n示例\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mangle 表的一个常见应用场景是实现策略路由，即根据不同的数据包选择不同的路由表进行转发。例如，如果我们想要让不同端口的数据包走不同的网关出去，我们可以使用 mangle 表来给数据包打上标记，然后根据标记来指定路由表。具体的步骤如下：\n首先，我们需要定义两个路由表，比如 10 和 20，并且分别添加默认路由到不同的网关。假设我们有两个网卡 eth1 和 eth2，分别连接到网关 202.106.x.x 和 211.108.x.x，我们可以使用 ip 命令来添加路由表\n然后，我们需要使用 mangle 表来给不同端口的数据包打上标记，比如我们想要让 80 和 443 端口的数据包走 eth1 网卡，而 20 和 21 端口的数据包走 eth2 网卡，我们可以使用 iptables 命令来设置 mangle 表\n最后，我们需要使用 ip 命令来添加规则，让打上标记的数据包按照对应的路由表进行转发\nraw 表\n介绍\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raw 表是 iptables 中用于处理特殊类型的数据包的表，它可以决定是否对数据包进行连接跟踪（connection tracking），即是否记录数据包的状态信息。连接跟踪是一种消耗资源的操作，如果我们想要提高性能或者避免某些问题，我们可以使用 raw 表来让某些数据包跳过连接跟踪。raw 表只包含两个链：PREROUTING 和 OUTPUT。raw 表是 iptables 中优先级最高的表，它会在其他任何表之前执行。\n示例\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raw 表的一个常见应用场景是处理 ICMP 数据包，即互联网控制消息协议数据包。ICMP 数据包是一种用于网络诊断和管理的数据包，比如 ping 命令就是发送 ICMP echo 请求并接收 ICMP echo 应答来测试网络连通性。如果我们想要禁止某些主机 ping 我们或者被我们 ping，我们可以使用 raw 表来设置规则。具体的步骤如下\n首先，我们需要确定要禁止 ping 的主机的 IP 地址，比如 192.168.1.100\n然后，我们需要使用 raw 表来设置规则，让该主机发出或者发往的 ICMP 数据包跳过连接跟踪，并且直接丢弃。我们可以使用 iptables 命令来设置 raw 表\n下面解释为什么使用 raw 表来禁止 ping 比使用 filter 表更好。\nping 命令是一种用于测试网络连通性的工具，它发送 ICMP 数据包到目标主机，并等待回应。如果目标主机能够正常响应，那么就说明网络是通的。如果目标主机无法响应，那么就说明网络有问题或者被阻止了。\n如果我们想要禁止某些主机 ping 我们或者被我们 ping，我们可以使用 iptables 的防火墙功能来设置规则，让 ICMP 数据包被丢弃或者拒绝。iptables 有四个表来管理不同类型的规则，分别是 filter、nat、mangle 和 raw。其中 filter 表是默认的表，用于过滤数据包；nat 表是用于实现网络地址转换；mangle 表是用于修改数据包的标记；raw 表是用于处理特殊类型的数据包。\n一般来说，我们可以使用 filter 表来禁止 ping，只需要在 INPUT 链和 OUTPUT 链上添加规则，让 ICMP 数据包被 DROP 或者 REJECT 即可。例如，如果我们想要禁止 192.168.1.100 这个主机 ping 我们或者被我们 ping，我们可以使用以下命令：\n这样做的效果是一样的，但是有一个缺点，就是 filter 表会对数据包进行连接跟踪（connection tracking），即记录数据包的状态信息。连接跟踪是一种消耗资源的操作，它会占用内存和 CPU 的资源，并且可能导致一些问题，如连接表溢出、连接超时等。如果我们不需要对 ICMP 数据包进行连接跟踪，那么使用 filter 表就是一种浪费。\n为了避免这种浪费，我们可以使用 raw 表来禁止 ping，只需要在 PREROUTING 链和 OUTPUT 链上添加规则，让 ICMP 数据包跳过连接跟踪，并且直接丢弃即可。例如，如果我们想要禁止 192.168.1.100 这个主机 ping 我们或者被我们 ping，我们可以使用以下命令：\n这样做的好处是可以节省资源和提高性能，因为 raw 表是 iptables 中优先级最高的表，它会在其他任何表之前执行，并且不会对数据包进行连接跟踪。这样就可以减少不必要的开销和风险。\n因此，使用 raw 表来禁止 ping 比使用 filter 表更好，除非我们有特殊的需求需要对 ICMP 数据包进行连接跟踪。\n参考文档：\niptables详解及常用规则\niptables详解\niptables规则设置用法\niptables

Annotations\nMethod Annotations\nArgument Annotations\nField Annotations\nClass Annotations\nDTrace Integration\nBTrace Samples\nBTrace is a safe, dynamic tracing tool for Java. BTrace works by dynamically (bytecode) instrumenting classes of a running Java program. BTrace inserts tracing actions into the classes of a running Java program and hotswaps the traced program classes.\nBTrace Terminology\nProbe Point\n“location” or “event” at which a set of tracing statements are executed. Probe point is “place” or “event” of interest where we want to execute some tracing statements.\nTrace Actions or Actions\nTrace statements that are executed whenever a probe “fires”.\nAction Methods\nBTrace trace statements that are executed when a probe fires are defined inside a static method a class. Such methods are called “action” methods.\nBTrace Program Structure\nA BTrace program is a plain Java class that has one or more public static void methods that are annotated with BTrace annotations. The annotations are used to specify traced program “locations” (also known as “probe points”). The tracing actions are specified inside the static method bodies. These static methods are referred as “action” methods.\nBTrace Restrictions\nTo guarantee that the tracing actions are “read-only” (i.e., the trace actions don’t change the state of the program traced) and bounded (i.e., trace actions terminate in bounded time), a BTrace program is allowed to do only a restricted set of actions. In particular, a BTrace class\ncan not create new objects.\ncan not create new arrays.\ncan not throw exceptions.\ncan not catch exceptions.\ncan not make arbitrary instance or static method calls - only the public static methods of com.sun.btrace.BTraceUtils class may be called from a BTrace program.\ncan not assign to static or instance fields of target program’s classes and objects. But, BTrace class can assign to it’s own static fields (“trace state” can be mutated).\ncan not have instance fields and methods. Only static public void returning methods are allowed for a BTrace class. And all fields have to be static.\ncan not have outer, inner, nested or local classes.\ncan not have synchronized blocks or synchronized methods.\ncan not have loops (for, while, do..while)\ncan not extend arbitrary class (super class has to be java.lang.Object)\ncan not implement interfaces.\ncan not contains assert statements.\ncan not use class literals.\nA simple BTrace program\nThe above BTrace program can be run against a running Java process. This program will print “about to start a thread!” at the BTrace client whenever the target program is about to start a thread by Thread.start() method. There are other interesting probe points possible. For example, we can insert trace action at return from a method, exception return from a method, a field get or set within method(s), object/array creation, line number(s), throwing an exception. Please refer to the @OnMethod and other annotations for details.\nSteps to run BTrace\nFind the process id of the target Java process that you want to trace. You can use jps tool to find the pid.\nWrite a BTrace program - you may want to start modifying one of the samples.\nRun btrace tool by the following command line:\nBTrace Command Line\nBTrace is run using the command line tool btrace as shown below:\nwhere\ninclude-path is a set of include directories that are searched for header files. BTrace includes a simple preprocess with support for #define, #include and conditional compilation. It is not like a complete C/C++ preprocessor - but a useful subset. See the sample “ThreadBean.java”. If -I is not specified, BTrace skips the preprocessor invocation step.\nport is the port in which BTrace agent listens. This is optional argument.\nclasspath is set of directories, jar files where BTrace searches for classes during compilation. Default is “.”.\npid is the process id of the traced Java program\nbtrace-script is the trace program. If it is a “.java”, then it is compiled before submission. Or else, it is assumed to be pre-compiled [i.e., it has to be a .class] and submitted.\noptional\nport is the server socket port at which BTrace agent listens for clients. Default is 2020.\npath is the classpath used for compiling BTrace program. Default is “.”.\nargs is command line arguments passed to BTrace program. BTrace program can access these using the built-in functions “$” and “$length”.\nPre-compiling BTrace scripts\nIt is possible to precompile BTrace program using btracec script. btracec is a javac-like program that takes a BTrace program and produces a .class file.\nwhere\ninclude-path is a set of include directories that are searched for header files. BTrace includes a simple preprocess with support for #define, #include and conditional compilation. It is not like a complete C/C++ preprocessor - but a useful subset. See the sample “ThreadBean.java”. If -I is not specified, BTrace skips the preprocessor invocation step.\nclasspath is the classpath used for compiling BTrace program(s). Default is “.”\ndirectory is the output directory where compiled .class files are stored. Default is “.”.\nThis script uses BTrace compiler class - rather than regular javac and therefore will validate your BTrace program at compile time [so that you can avoid BTrace verify error at runtime].\nStarting an application with BTrace agent\nSo far, we saw how to trace a running Java program. It is also possible to start an application with BTrace agent in it. If you want to start tracing the application from the very “beginning”, you may want to start the app with BTrace agent and specify a trace script along with it [i.e., BTrace agent is attach-on-demand loadable as well as pre-loadable agent] You can use the following command to start an app and specify BTrace script file. But, you need to precompile your BTrace script for this kind of usage.\nWhen starting the application this way, the trace output goes to a file named &lt;btrace-class-file-name&gt;.btrace in the current directory. Also, you can avoid starting server for other remote BTrace clients by specifying noServer=true as an argument to the BTrace agent.\nThere is a convenient script called btracer to do the above:\nBTrace Annotations\nMethod Annotations\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnMethod annotation can be used to specify target class(es), target method(s) and “location(s)” within the method(s). An action method annotated by this annotation is called when the matching method(s) reaches specified the location. In OnMethod annotation, traced class name is specified by “clazz” property and traced method is specified by “method” property. “clazz” may be a fully qualified class name (like java.awt.Component or a regular expression specified within two forward slashes. Refer to the samples NewComponent.java and Classload.java. The regular expression can match zero or more classes in which case all matching classes are instrumented. For example /java\\\\.awt\\\\..+/ matches all classes in java.awt package. Also, method name can be a regular expression as well - matching zero or more methods. Refer to the sample MultiClass.java. There is another way to abstractly specify traced class(es) and method(s). Traced classes and methods may be specified by annotation. For example, if the “clazz” attribute is specified as @javax.jws.WebService BTrace will instrument all classes that are annotated by the WebService annotation. Similarly, method level annotations may be used to specify methods abstractly. Refer to the sample WebServiceTracker.java. It is also possible to combine regular expressions with annotations - like @/com\\\\.acme\\\\..+/ matches any class that is annotated by any annotation that matches the given regular expression. It is possible to match multiple classes by specifying super type. i.e., match all classes that are subtypes of a given super type. +java.lang.Runnable matches all classes implementing java.lang.Runnable interface. Refer to the sample SubtypeTracer.java.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnTimer annotation can be used to specify tracing actions that have to run periodically once every N milliseconds. Time period is specified as long “value” property of this annotation. Refer to the sample Histogram.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnError annotation can be used to specify actions that are run whenever any exception is thrown by tracing actions of some other probe. BTrace method annotated by this annotation is called when any exception is thrown by any of the other BTrace action methods in the same BTrace class.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnExit annotation can be used to specify actions that are run when BTrace code calls “exit(int)” built-in function to finish the tracing “session”. Refer to the sample ProbeExit.java.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnEvent annotation is used to associate tracing methods with “external” events send by BTrace client. BTrace methods annotated by this annotation are called when BTrace client sends an “event”. Client may send an event based on some form of user request to send (like pressing Ctrl-C or a GUI menu). String value may used as the name of the event. This way certain tracing actions can be executed whenever an external event “fires”. As of now, the command line BTrace client sends “events” whenever use presses Ctrl-C (SIGINT). On SIGINT, a console menu is shown to send an event or exit the client [which is the default for SIGINT]. Refer to the sample HistoOnEvent.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnLowMemory annotation can be used to trace memory threshold exceed event. See sample MemAlerter.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.OnProbe annotation can be used to specify to avoid using implementation internal classes in BTrace scripts. @OnProbe probe specifications are mapped to one or more @OnMethod specifications by the BTrace VM agent. Currently, this mapping is done using a XML probe descriptor file [accessed by the BTrace agent]. Refer to the sample SocketTracker1.java and associated probe descriptor file java.net.socket.xml. When running this sample, this xml file needs to be copied in the directory where the target JVM runs (or fix probeDescPath option in btracer.bat to point to whereever the .xml file is).\nArgument Annotations\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.Self annotation can be used to mark an argument to hold this (or self) value. Refer to the samples AWTEventTracer.java or AllCalls1.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.Return annotation can be used to mark an argument to hold the return value. Refer to the sample Classload.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.ProbeClassName (since 1.1) annotation can be used to mark an argument to hold the probed class name value. Refer to the sample AllMethods.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.ProbeMethodName (since 1.1) annotation can be used to mark an argument to hold the probed method name. Refer to the sample WebServiceTracker.java\nsince 1.2 it accepts boolean parameter fqn to get a fully qualified probed method name\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.Duration annotation can be used to mark an argument to hold the duration of the method call in nanoseconds. The argument must be a long. Use with Kind.RETURN or Kind.ERROR locations.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.TargetInstance (since 1.1) annotation can be used to mark an argument to hold the called instance value. Refer to the sample AllCalls2.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.TargetMethodOrField (since 1.1) can be used to mark an argument to hold the called method name. Refer to the samples AllCalls1.java or AllCalls2.java\nsince 1.2 it accepts boolean parameter fqn to get a fully qualified target method name\nUnannotated arguments\nThe unannotated BTrace probe method arguments are used for the signature matching and therefore they must appear in the order they are defined in the traced method. However, they can be interleaved with any number of annotated arguments. If an argument of type *AnyType[]* is used it will “eat” all the rest of the arguments in they order. The exact meaning of the unannotated arguments depends on the Location used:\nKind.ENTRY, Kind.RETURN- the probed method arguments\nKind.THROW - the thrown exception\nKind.ARRAY_SET, Kind.ARRAY_GET - the array index\nKind.CATCH - the caught exception\nKind.FIELD_SET - the field value\nKind.LINE - the line number\nKind.NEW - the class name\nKind.ERROR - the thrown exception\nField Annotations\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.Export annotation can be used with BTrace fields (static fields) to specify that the field has to be mapped to a jvmstat counter. Using this, a BTrace program can expose tracing counters to external jvmstat clients (such as jstat). Refer to the sample ThreadCounter.java\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.Property annotation can be used to flag a specific (static) field as a MBean attribute. If a BTrace class has atleast one static field with @Property attribute, then a MBean is created and registered with platform MBean server. JMX clients such as VisualVM, jconsole can be used to view such BTrace MBeans. After attaching BTrace to the target program, you can attach VisualVM or jconsole to the same program and view the newly created BTrace MBean. With VisualVM and jconsole, you can use MBeans tab to view the BTrace domain and check out it’s attributes. Refer to the samples ThreadCounterBean and HistogramBean.java.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.TLS annotation can be used with BTrace fields (static fields) to specify that the field is a thread local field. Each Java thread gets a separate “copy” of the field. These thread local fields may be used by BTrace programs to identify whether we reached multiple probe actions from the same thread or not. Refer to the samples OnThrow.java and WebServiceTracker.java\nClass Annotations\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.DTrace annotation can be used to associate a simple one-liner D-script (inlined in BTrace Java class) with the BTrace program. Refer to the sample DTraceInline.java.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.DTraceRef annotation can be used to associate a D-script (stored in a separate file) with the BTrace program. Refer to the sample DTraceRefDemo.java.\n@com.sun.btrace.annotations.BTrace annotation must be used to designate a given Java class as a BTrace program. This annotation is enforced by the BTrace compiler as well as by the BTrace agent.\nDTrace Integration\nSolaris DTrace is a dynamic, safe tracing system for Solaris programs - both kernel and user land programs. Because of the obvious parallels b/w DTrace and BTrace, it is natural to expect integration b/w BTrace and DTrace. There are two ways in which BTrace is integrated with DTrace.\nBTrace program can raise a DTrace probe - by calling dtraceProbe – see BTraceUtils javadoc referred above. For this feature to work, you need to be running on Solaris 10 or beyond. For other platforms (Solaris 9 or below or any other OS), dtraceProbe() will be a no-op.\nBTrace program can associate a D-script with it– by @DTrace annotation (if the D-script is a simple one liner) or by @DTraceRef if the D-script is longer and hence stored outside of the BTrace program. See DTrace integration samples in the BTrace samples section below. This feature works using the DTrace Java API. For this DTrace feature to work (o.e., being able to run associated D-script), you need to be running on Solaris 11 build 35 or beyond. You may want to check whether you have /usr/share/lib/java/dtrace.jar on your machine or not. @DTrace and @DTraceRef annotations are ignored on other platforms (Solaris 10 or below or any other OS).\nBTrace Samples\nBTrace samples\nOne lines about samples:\nAWTEventTracer.java - demonstates tracing of AWT events by instrumenting EventQueue.dispatchEvent() method. Can filter events by instanceof check. This sample filters and prints only focus events.\nAllLines.java - demonstates line number based BTrace probes. It is possible to probe into any class (or classes) and line number(s). When the specified line number(s) of specified class(es) is reached, the BTrace probe fires and the corresponding action is executed.\nArgArray.java - prints all input arguments in every readXXX method of every class in java.io package. Demonstrates argument array access and multiple class/method matching in probe specifications.\nClassload.java - prints stack trace on every successful classload (defineClass returns) by any userdefined class loader.\nCommandArg.java - demonstrates BTrace command line argument access.\nDeadlock.java - demonstrates @OnTimer probe and deadlock() built-in function.\nDTraceInline.java - demonstrates @DTrace annotation to associate a simple one-line D-script with the BTrace program.\nDTraceRefDemo.java - demonstrates @DTraceRef annotation to associate a D-script file with the BTrace program. This sample associates classload.d with itself.\nFileTracker.java - prints file open for read/write by probing into File{Input/Output}Stream constructor entry points.\nFinalizeTracker.java - demonstrates that we can print all fields of an object and access (private) fields (read-only) as well. This is useful in debugging / troubleshooting scenarios. This sample prints info on close() /finalize() methods of java.io.FileInputStream class.\nHistogram.java - demonstates usage of BTrace maps for collecting histogram (of javax.swing.JComponent objects created by an app - histogram by subclass name and count).\nHistogramBean.java - demonstates JMX integration. This sample exposes a Map as MBean attribute using @Property annotation.\nHistoOnEvent.java - demonstrates getting trace output based on client side event. After starting the script by BTrace client, press Ctrl-C to get menu to send event or exit. On sending event, histogram is printed. This way client can “pull” trace output whenever needed rather than BTrace agent pushing the trace output always or based on timer.\nJdbcQueries.java - demonstrates BTrace aggregation facility. This facility is similar to DTrace aggregation facility.\nJInfo.java - demonstrates printVmArguments(), printProperties() and printEnv() built-in functions.\nJMap.java - demonstrates dumpHeap() built-in function to dump (hprof binary format) heap dump of the target application.\nJStack.java - demonstrates jstackAll() built-in function to print stack traces of all the threads.\nLogTracer.java - demonstrates trapping into an instance method (Logger.log) and printing private field value (of LogRecord object) by field() and objectValue() built-in functions.\nMemAlerter.java - demonstrates tracing low memory event by @OnLowMememory annotation.\nMemory.java - prints memory stat once every 4 seconds by a timer probe. Demonstrates memory stat built-in functions.\nMultiClass.java - demonstrates inserting trace code into multiple methods of multiple classes using regular expressions for clazz and method fields of @OnMethod annotation.\nNewComponent.java - tracks every java.awt.Component creation and increments a counter and prints the counter based on a timer.\nOnThrow.java - prints exception stack trace every time any exception instance is created. In most scenarios, exceptions are thrown immediately after creation. So, it we get stack trace of throw points.\nProbeExit.java - demonstrates @OnExit probe and exit(int) built-in function.\nSizeof.java - demonstates “sizeof” built-in function that can be used to get (approx.) size of a given Java object. It is possible to get size-wise histogram etc. using this built-in.\nSocketTracker.java - prints every server socker creation/bind and client socket accepts.\nSocketTracker1.java - similar to SocketTracker.java sample, except that this sample uses @OnProbe probes to avoid using Sun specific socket channel implementation classes in BTrace program. Instead @OnProbe probes are mapped to @OnMethod probes by BTrace agent.\nSysProp.java - demonstrates that it is okay to probe into System classes (like java.lang.System) and call BTrace built-in functions in the action method.\nSubtypeTracer.java - demonstrates that it is possible to match all subtypes of a given supertype.\nThreadCounter.java - demonstrates use of jvmstat counters from BTrace programs.\nThreadCounterBean.java - demonstrates exposing the BTrace program as a JMX bean with one attribute (using @Property annotation).\nThreadBean.java - demonstrates the use of preprocessor of BTrace [and JMX integratio].\nThreadStart.java - demonstrates raising DTrace probes from BTrace programs. See also jthread.d - the associated D-script. This sample raises a DTrace USDT probe whenever the traced program enters java.lang.Thread.start() method. The BTrace program passes JavaThread’s name to DTrace.\nTimers.java - demonstrates multiple timer probes (@OnTimer) in a BTrace program.\nURLTracker.java - prints URL every time URL.openConnection returns successfully. This program uses jurls.d D-script as well (to show histogram of URLs opened via DTrace).\nWebServiceTracker.java - demonstates tracing classes and methods by specifying class and method level annotations rather than class and method names.","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/java-btrace-tour/","title":"BTrace User's

测试示例，帮助你在不同业务场景下快速选择与落地。\n注意：异常值并非总是“错误”。许多业务的“尖峰”有可能是合理的事件。本文更像一套工具箱，你需要结合业务知识合理使用与调参。\n1. 基于统计学方法的异常值检测\nZ-Score 方法\n思想：计算全局均值 μ 与标准差 σ，当某点 x 满足 | (x-μ) / σ | &gt; k（常用阈值 k=3）时，判为异常。\n适用：近似正态分布、峰值显著偏离整体均值的场景。\nIQR (四分位距) 方法\n思想：计算 Q1、Q3 与 IQR=Q3-Q1，当点落在 [Q1 - α·IQR, Q3 + α·IQR] 之外（常用 α=1.5 或 3.0）判为异常。\n适用：偏态分布或存在重尾时较稳健（受极端值影响较小）。\n2. 基于移动窗口的异常值检测\n滑动窗口 Z-Score\n思想：用邻域窗口的均值与标准差代替全局统计，适合非平稳或趋势性数据。\n移动平均法\n思想：用窗口均值/中位数做局部“期望值”，当当前点偏离窗口均值超过一定阈值即判异常。\n常见阈值：绝对差超过 β·σ_window 或超过固定常数 δ。\n3. 基于相邻点距离的异常值检测\n思想：突刺常表现为与相邻点差值显著增大。可用固定阈值或鲁棒阈值（如差值的 MAD 或四分位距）来判断。\n4. 综合多种方法的异常值检测\n思想：多模型投票或加权融合。只有当多个方法一致判定为异常时才去除，可降低误杀风险。\n5. 完整代码：OutlierDetectors.java（可直接复制使用）\n6. 测试用例（JUnit 5）\n7. 实际应用示例\n例如 IoT 设备的温度读数，每分钟一个点，偶尔出现硬件抖动导致的尖峰。建议：\n先用“滑动窗口 Z-Score（window=5，k=3）”检测局部异常。\n再用“相邻点距离（robust=true）”做二次确认。\n两者都判异常才移除（votesRequired=2）。\n这样可以兼顾对局部突变的敏感性与稳健性，降低误杀风险。\n8. 性能优化建议\n预计算滚动均值/方差（O(n)），避免重复遍历。\n大数据量时优先选用 IQR/MAD 等一次扫描算法。\n使用并行流或分块处理提升吞吐（注意线程安全）。\n对近似实时流，优先滑窗方法，避免全量重算。\n对多次查询的静态数据，缓存中间统计结果。\n9. 注意事项（强烈推荐实践）\n数据预处理：在检测异常值之前，先过滤掉 NULL 值和 NaN 值。\n参数选择：根据具体业务场景调整阈值（如 Z-Score 的 k、IQR 的 α、滑窗大小、β 等）。\n数据分布：考虑数据分布特性，正态更适合 Z-Score，偏态/重尾用 IQR/MAD 更稳健。\n性能考虑：大数据量时使用近似方法或并行处理；滚动统计更高效。\n业务逻辑：结合业务知识判断哪些“异常值”实际上是合理的事件，不要轻易删除。\n10. 代码运行说明（可选）\n复制 OutlierDetectors.java 与测试到你的工程。\n使用 Maven/Gradle 引入 JUnit 5 后运行测试。\n或直接 javac OutlierDetectors.java 后运行 java OutlierDetectors 查看演示输出。\n以上方法可根据你的具体需求进行选择和调整，以有效去除 Double

The purgatory holds any request that hasn’t yet met its criteria to succeed but also hasn’t yet resulted in an error. The problem is “How can we efficiently keep track of tens of thousands of requests that are being asynchronously satisfied by other activity in the cluster?”\nKafka implements several request types that cannot immediately be answered with a response. Examples:\nA produce request with acks=all cannot be considered complete until all in-sync replicas have acknowledged the write and we can guarantee it will not be lost if the leader fails.\nA fetch request with min.bytes=1 won’t be answered until there is at least one new byte of data for the consumer to consume. This allows a “long poll” so that the consumer need not busy wait checking for new data to arrive.\nThese requests are considered complete when either (a) the criteria they requested is complete or (b) some timeout occurs.\nThe number of these asynchronous operations in flight at any time scales with the number of connections, which, for Kafka, is often tens of thousands.\nThe request purgatory is designed for such a large scale request handling, but the old implementation had a number of deficiencies.\nIn this blog, I would like to explain the problem with the old implementation and how the new implementation solved it. I will also present benchmark results.\nOld Purgatory Design\nThe request purgatory consists of a timeout timer and a hash map of watcher lists for event driven processing. A request is put into the purgatory when it is not immediately satisfiable because of unmet conditions. A request in the purgatory is completed later when the conditions are met or is forced to be completed (timeout) when it passed beyond the time specified in the timeout parameter of the request. In the old design, it used Java DelayQueue to implement the timer.\nWhen a request is completed, the request is not deleted from the timer or watcher lists immediately. Instead, completed requests are deleted as they were found during condition checking. When the deletion does not keep up, the server may exhaust JVM heap and cause OutOfMemoryError.\nTo alleviate the situation, a separate thread, called the reaper thread, purges completed requests from the purgatory when the number of requests (either pending or completed) in the purgatory exceeds the configured number. The purge operation scans the timer queue and all watcher lists to find completed requests and deletes them.\nBy setting this configuration parameter low, the server can virtually avoid the memory problem. However, the server must pay a significant performance penalty if it scans all lists too frequently.\nNew Purgatory Design\nThe goal of the new design is to allow immediate deletion of a completed request and reduce the load of expensive purge process significantly. It requires cross referencing of entries in the timer and the requests. Also it is strongly desired to have O(1) insert/delete cost since insert/delete operation happens for each request/completion.\nTo satisfy these requirements, we designed a new purgatory implementation based on Hierarchical Timing Wheels [1].\nHierarchical Timing Wheel\nA simple timing wheel is a circular list of buckets of timer tasks. Let u be the time unit. A timing wheel with size n has n buckets and can hold timer tasks in n * u time interval. Each bucket holds timer tasks that fall into the corresponding time range. At the beginning, the first bucket holds tasks for [0, u), the second bucket holds tasks for [u, 2u), …, the n-th bucket for [u * (n -1), u * n). Every interval of time unit u, the timer ticks and moved to the next bucket then expire all timer tasks in it. So, the timer never inserts a task into the bucket for the current time since it is already expired. The timer immediately runs the expired task. The emptied bucket is then available for the next round, so if the current bucket is for the time t, it becomes the bucket for [t + u * n, t + (n + 1) * u) after a tick. A timing wheel has O(1) cost for insert/delete (start-timer/stop-timer) whereas priority queue based timers, such as java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue and java.util.Timer, have O(log n) insert/delete cost. Note that neither DelayQueue or Timer supports random delete.\nA major drawback of a simple timing wheel is that it assumes that a timer request is within the time interval of n * u from the current time. If a timer request is out of this interval, it is an overflow. A hierarchical timing wheel deals with such overflows. It is a hierarchically organized timing wheels&nbsp;that delegate overflows to upper level wheels. The lowest level has the finest time resolution. Time resolutions become coarser as we move up the hierarchy. If the resolution of a wheel at one level is u and the size is n, the resolutions should be n * u in the second level, n2 * u in the third level, and so on. At each level overflows are delegated to the wheel in one level higher. When the wheel in the higher level ticks, it reinsert timer tasks to the lower level. An overflow wheel can be created on-demand. When a bucket in an overflow bucket expires, all tasks in it are reinserted into the timer recursively. The tasks are then moved to the finer grain wheels or be executed. The insert (start-timer) cost is O(m) where m is the number of wheels, which is usually very small compared to the number of requests in the system, and the delete (stop-timer) cost is still O(1).\nDoubly Linked List for Buckets in Timing Wheels\nIn the new design, we use own implementation of doubly linked list for the buckets in a timing wheel. The advantage of doubly linked list that it allows O(1) insert/delete of a list item if we have access link cells in a list.\nA timer task instance saves a link cell in itself when enqueued to a timer queue. When a task is completed or canceled, the list is updated using the link cell saved in the task itself.\nDriving Clock using DelayQueue\nA simple implementation may use a thread that wakes up every unit time and does the ticking, which checks if there is any task in the bucket. The unit time of the purgatory is 1ms (u = 1ms). This can be wasteful if requests are sparse at the wheel at the lowest level. This is usually the case because the majority of requests are satisfied before inserted into the wheel at the lowest level. It would be nice if a thread wakes up only when there is a non-empty bucket to expire. The new purgatory does so by using java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue similarly to the old implementation, but we enqueue task buckets instead of individual tasks. This design has a performance advantage. The number of items in DelayQueue is capped by the number of buckets, which is usually much smaller than the number of tasks, thus the number of offer/poll operations to the priority queue inside DelayQueue will be significantly smaller.\nPurging Watcher Lists\nIn the old implementation, the purge operation of watcher lists is triggered by the total size if the watcher lists. The problem is that the watcher lists may exceed the threshold even when there isn’t many requests to purge. When this happens it increases the CPU load a lot. Ideally, the purge operation should be triggered by the number of completed requests the watcher lists.\nIn the new design, a completed request is removed from the timer queue immediately with O(1) cost. It means that the number of requests in the timer queue is the number of pending requests exactly at any time. So, if we know the total number of distinct requests in the purgatory, which includes the sum of the number of pending request and the numbers completed but still watched requests, we can avoid unnecessary purge operations. It is not trivial to keep track of the exact number of distinct requests in the purgatory because a request may or may not be watched. In the new design, we estimate the total number of requests in the purgatory rather than trying to maintain the exactly number.\nThe estimated number of requests are maintained as follows.\nThe estimated total number of requests, E, is incremented whenever a new request is watched.\nBefore starting the purge operation, we reset the estimated total number of requests to the size of timer queue. This is the current number of pending requests. If no requests are added to the purgatory during purge, E is the correct number of requests after purge.\nIf some requests are added to the purgatory during purge, E is incremented to E + the number of newly watched requests. This may be an overestimation because it is possible that some of the new requests are completed and remove from the watcher lists during the purge operation. We expect the chance of overestimation and an amount of overestimation are small.\nBenchmark\nWe compared the enqueue performance of two purgatory implementations, the old implementation and the new implementation. This is a micro benchmark. It measures just the purgatory enqueue performance. The purgatory was separated from the rest of the system and also uses a fake request which does nothing useful. So, the throughput of the purgatory in a real system may be lower than the number shown by the test.\nIn the test, the intervals of the requests are assumed to follow the exponential distribution. Each request takes a time drawn from a log-normal distribution. By adjusting the shape of the log-normal distribution, we can test different timeout rate.\nThe tick size is 1ms and the wheel size is 20. The timeout was set to 200ms. The data size of a request was 100 bytes. For a low timeout rate case, we chose 75percentile = 60ms and 50percentile = 20. And for a high timeout rate case, we chose 75percentile = 400ms and 50percentile = 200ms. Total 1 million requests are enqueued in each run.\nRequests are actively completed by a separate thread. Requests that are supposed to be completed before timeout are enqueued to another DelayQueue. And a separate thread keeps polling and completes them. There is no guarantee of accuracy in terms of actual completion time.\nThe JVM heap size is set to 200m to reproduce a memory tight situation.\nThe result shows a dramatic difference in a high enqueue rate area. As the target rate increases, both implementations keep up with the requests initially. However, in low timeout scenario the old implementation was saturated around 40000 RPS (request per second), whereas the new implementation didn’t show any significant performance degradation, and in high timeout scenario the old implementation was saturated around 25000 RPS, whereas the new implementation was saturated 105000 RPS in this benchmark.\nAlso, CPU usage is significantly better in the new implementation. Note that the old implementation does not have data point higher than ~40000 RPS due to its scalability limit. Also notice that its CPU time saturates around 1.2 while it is steadily going up in the new implementation. It indicate that the old implementation may be hitting a concurrency issue due to synchronizations.\nFinally, we measured total GC time (milliseconds) for ParNew collection and CMS collection. There isn’t much difference in the old implementation and the new implementation in the region of enqueue rate that the old implementation can sustain. Again note that old implementation does not have data point higher than ~40000 RPS due to its scalability limit.\nSummary\nIn the new design, we use Hierarchical Timing Wheels for the timeout timer and DelayQueue of timer buckets to advance the clock on demand. Completed requests are removed from the timer queue immediately with O(1) cost. The buckets remain in the delay queue, however, the number of buckets is bounded. And, in a healthy system, most of the requests are satisfied before timeout, and many of the buckets become empty before pulled out of the delay queue. Thus, the timer should rarely have the buckets of the lower interval. The advantage of this design is that the number of requests in the timer queue is the number of pending requests exactly at any time. This allows us to estimate the number of requests need to be purged. We can avoid unnecessary purge operation of the watcher lists. As the result we achieve a higher scalability in terms of request rate with much better CPU usage.\nReferences\n[1] George Varghese , Anthony Lauck, Hashed and hierarchical timing wheels: efficient data structures for implementing a timer facility, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON), v.5 n.6, p.824-834, Dec. 1997","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/kafka-purgatory-hierarchicaltimingwheels/","title":"Apache Kafka, Purgatory, and Hierarchical Timing Wheels"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/kafka-top-10-optimizations/":{"body":"摘要\n本文系统梳理提升 Kafka 吞吐与稳定性的十项关键调优，并结合生产经验给出参数示例、取舍建议与监控要点。内容涵盖主题分区、复制滞后、代理线程、生产者压缩、确认策略、消费者抓取、网络缓冲、KRaft 元数据超时、磁盘日志目录与复制因子。读完你可建立一套具备技术深度与工程可执行性的 Kafka 调优方法论。\n架构总览（图解）\n关键瓶颈通常出现在：分区并行度不足、复制滞后、网络/磁盘 IO 饱和、抓取批次过小或等待过长。\n1) 增加分区数量（提高并行度）\n原理：分区是并行与扩展的基本单位，消费者组的并发度≈分区数。\n实践：热点主题优先扩分区，但避免超过消费者实例数太多导致上下文切换增多。\n命令示例：\n经验：批次大、压缩好时分区更易发挥并行优势；观察 record-send-rate 与端到端延迟平衡扩分区节奏。\n2) 控制复制滞后 replica.lag.time.max.ms\n原理：跟随者滞后超过阈值会被踢出 ISR，影响持久性与写入确认路径。\n配置：\n取舍：滞后阈值太短易频繁出入 ISR，太长则风险积累；结合 min.insync.replicas 与 acks 联动。\n3) 调整代理线程 num.network.threads / num.io.threads\n原理：网络线程负责连接与请求，IO 线程处理磁盘与日志操作。\n配置：\n经验：磁盘为 SSD 且网络连接多时适当加大 IO/网络线程；监控线程池队列长度与请求处理时间。\n4) 生产者压缩 compression.type\n原理：减小网络传输与磁盘写入体积，提高吞吐；常用 lz4 兼顾速度与压缩率。\n经验：压缩在高吞吐场景收益明显；CPU 紧张或消息极小（&lt;几百字节）时可降低 batch 或取消压缩。\n5) 设置适当的生产者确认 acks\n原理：acks=1 追求速度，acks=all 追求持久性。\n经验：关键交易流选择 acks=all + min.insync.replicas&gt;=2；日志/监控流可选 acks=1 提升吞吐。\n6) 消费者 Fetch 调优\n原理：每次抓取的最小字节与最大等待影响吞吐与延迟。\n经验：延迟敏感业务降低 fetch.max.wait.ms；吞吐优先业务增大 fetch.min.bytes 与 max.partition.fetch.bytes。\n7) Socket 缓冲（网络层关键）\n原理：发送/接收缓冲影响突发流量可承载能力。\n经验：结合 NIC 驱动与 MTU 调优；观察丢包/重传与队列长度，避免过度放大导致内存占用攀升。\n8) KRaft 元数据超时\n原理：KRaft 替代 ZooKeeper，选举与元数据请求的超时影响控制面稳定性。\n经验：在网络抖动或控制器负载高时适当放宽；务必结合当前 Kafka 版本文档验证参数名与默认值。\n9) 多目录 log.dirs 优化磁盘 IO\n原理：多物理盘分散日志写入与读取，降低单盘瓶颈。\n经验：保持盘间均衡与独立挂载；注意文件系统选型与磁盘调度器（SSD 建议 none/mq-deadline）。\n10) 复制因子 Replication Factor 与最小 ISR\n原理：复制因子提升容灾能力；min.insync.replicas 决定可写安全阈值。\n经验：一般生产建议 RF=3；跨机架部署配合机架感知，保障副本分布合理。\n监控与验证清单\n关键指标：request-rate/queue、records-per-request、bytes-in/out、replica-lag、fetch-latency、磁盘/网络利用率。\n端到端：生产-代理-消费延迟分解，定位瓶颈链路。\n回归测试：基准压测覆盖消息大小分布、峰值/平均 QPS、网络/磁盘抖动。\n变更策略：逐项调参、灰度发布、可回滚，记录版本与参数快照。\n个人实践经验（取舍原则）\n先“结构性并行”（分区数）再“局部高效”（批次与压缩）；避免只堆参数不改架构。\n写入安全三件套：acks=all + min.insync.replicas&gt;=2 + RF&gt;=3；有压测支撑再降级到 acks=1。\n抓取参数面向业务目标：低延迟用小批次、吞吐优先用大批次+等待。\n网络与磁盘是基础设施瓶颈，Kafka 参数只是“放大器”，必须与 OS/NIC/盘配置协同优化。\n参考资料\nKafka 调优十招：https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RyPrlIps1tWUWgQcIyiEvw","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/kafka-top-10-optimizations/","title":"Kafka 调优十招：原理、实践与取舍"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/kafka/":{"body":"","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/kafka/","title":"Kafka 源码解读"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/kafka/00-kafka-source-code-outline/":{"body":"Apache Kafka 是分布式流处理平台的标杆。本系列将基于 Kafka 3.x 源码（Scala + Java），深入剖析其底层原理。\nPhase 1: 基础与架构 (Architecture &amp; Basics)\n01. 环境搭建与源码编译: 如何构建 Kafka 源码（Gradle），IntelliJ IDEA 调试环境配置。\n02. 架构概览: Broker, Topic, Partition, Replica, AR/ISR, HW/LEO 核心概念解析。\nPhase 2: 生产者 (Producer)\n03.

模式）的差异及实操要点。\n1) 网络隔离性\nHost 模式：进程/容器直接加入宿主机的网络命名空间，复用同一网络栈与接口（如 eth0、lo）。没有网络隔离，容器内看到的 127.0.0.1 与宿主机一致。\n非 Host 模式：为进程/容器创建独立的网络命名空间，通常通过 veth 与宿主机桥接（bridge）或使用 macvlan/ipvlan 等机制。命名空间间网络栈相互隔离，需要显式路由/端口映射才能互访。\n2) 网络配置\nHost 模式：\n使用宿主机 IP 与端口，直接在主机 iptables/tc 规则范围内活动。\n端口冲突需自行避免（容器与宿主机服务共享同一端口空间）。\n非 Host 模式：\n容器/进程拥有独立 IP（来自 bridge/maclvan 网络），与宿主机通过 NAT（-p 端口映射）或路由互通。\n端口映射通常通过 iptables nat 表 PREROUTING/OUTPUT/POSTROUTING 完成；也可不经 NAT，直接在同一二层网络下互通（macvlan/ipvlan）。\n3) 性能影响\nHost 模式：路径最短，无 veth/bridge/NAT 额外开销，通常更低延迟与更高吞吐。避免 conntrack 压力与 SNAT 代价，适合高 PPS/低延迟场景。\n非 Host 模式：存在 veth、bridge、NAT/conntrack 等开销。若采用 macvlan/ipvlan 且不经 NAT，性能介于 Host 与 bridge+NAT 之间。开启/关闭网卡与栈的硬件卸载（GRO/LRO/TSO）也会影响实际性能。\n4) 安全性\nHost 模式：安全性较低。进程/容器可访问宿主机网络栈（包含 lo），宿主机 INPUT/OUTPUT 规则直接影响容器，容器误配置更易影响全机网络。\n非 Host 模式：命名空间隔离更强，可在容器 netns 内单独维护 iptables，并在宿主机上通过 FORWARD 与 bridge 接口集中治理。适合多租户、严格边界控制与网络策略（NetworkPolicy）场景。\n5) 使用场景\nHost 模式：\n需要极致网络性能与最低延迟的服务（如负载均衡、数据面代理、主机级监控代理如 node_exporter）。\n必须直接绑定宿主机地址的守护进程（如监听 :80/:443 的反向代理）。\n非 Host 模式：\n多租户隔离、零信任分段、需精细网络策略与审计的微服务集群。\n需要不同 IP/路由域的服务编排，简化冲突管理与迁移。\n6) 配置示例\nDocker\nHost 模式：\nBridge（非 Host）模式：\nMacvlan（非 Host）模式：\nKubernetes\nHost 网络：\n非 Host（由 CNI 提供隔离网络）：\n手动 netns（Linux 原生）\n7) 与 iptables/ipset/tc 的集成差异\nHost 模式：\niptables：容器进程经过宿主机 OUTPUT/INPUT（本机出入站）与 FORWARD（转发场景）。可直接在宿主机使用 -m cgroup/-m set 做准入与标记。\ntc：建议在实际出站接口（如 eth0）布置队列与过滤器，cgroup 过滤器可直接匹配该进程的 classid。\n非 Host 模式：\niptables：容器流量经 veth 进入宿主机 bridge，一般走 FORWARD 链与 nat。可在宿主机匹配 -i vethX/bridge 端口，或进入容器 netns 内单独维护防火墙。\ntc：可以选择在容器 eth0（命名空间内）、宿主机 veth 对端或 bridge 设备上布置队列与过滤器；若使用 cgroup 过滤器，仍可匹配由 net_cls 标记的套接字，但需确保过滤器挂载在实际经过的数据路径设备上。\n8) 实际注意事项\n端口与地址：Host 模式需要避免端口冲突与误监听（容器监听 127.0.0.1 即为宿主机回环）。非 Host 模式建议通过 Service/Ingress 或明确路由暴露服务。\n策略边界：非 Host 模式可在容器 netns 内单独维护 iptables/ipset，并在宿主机通过 FORWARD 与 bridge 汇总治理；Host 模式建议统一在宿主机层做分段与速率控制。\n性能与可靠性：\n关注 conntrack 容量与哈希：非 Host NAT 场景下可调 nf_conntrack_max 与 hashsize，避免高并发丢包。\n选择合适队列算法：fq_codel/cake 抑制 Bufferbloat；HTB 做带宽层次管理。\n评估硬件卸载与 GRO/LRO/TSO 开关对延迟/CPU 的影响。\n兼容性：Kubernetes hostNetwork: true 与 CNI/NetworkPolicy 的交互因实现而异，需结合具体 CNI 文档验证策略是否仍生效或需要例外规则。\n持久化与编排：在主机用 systemd unit/开机脚本持久化 iptables/tc；容器场景可在入口脚本中执行 netns 内规则，或使用宿主机守护进程监听容器生命周期事件同步策略。\n基本概念与工作原理\ncgroups（控制组）用于按进程维度进行资源隔离与配额管理。网络相关的两个传统控制器：\nnet_cls（v1）：为所属 cgroup 的进程产生的网络包打上 32 位 classid（位于 skb-&gt;priority），用于后续在 tc 中以 cgroup 过滤器分类，或在 iptables 以 -m cgroup 匹配。\nnet_prio（v1）：按接口为 socket 设置优先级（较少使用）。\ncgroup v2 差异：统一层级中不再包含 net_cls/net_prio 控制器。现代内核推荐用 BPF（如 tc eBPF + clsact，或 cgroup-bpf 钩子）实现按进程/服务的网络分类与策略。本文以 v1 net_cls 为主，并给出 v2 的替代思路。\nASCII 流程示意：\n配置步骤与命令示例（cgroup v1 net_cls）\n说明与建议：\nclassid 为 32 位，常用高 16 位表示主类、低 16 位表示子类，便于分层管理。\nsystemd 环境下也可按服务/切片组织进程，但 net_cls 赋值仍需在对应 cgroup 路径设置。\n与 iptables、ipset、tc 的集成使用\ntc（按 cgroup 分类到限速类）\niptables（匹配 cgroup 并打标/过滤）\n与 ipset 组合（进程 + 目的 IP 集合的双重约束）\n方向选择与注意：\n进程级匹配更适合本机 egress（OUTPUT）策略；PREROUTING/转发链不一定能关联本机进程。\n结合现有“按 IP 集合限速”的方案，可通过 cgroup 将本机服务与离线任务区分，避免彼此影响。\n应用场景与最佳实践\n按服务/作业限速：将备份、日志上传、离线批处理进程放入 cgroup，限制其带宽与队列优先级，保障交互服务。\n多租户主机：不同服务（租户）映射不同 classid，在 HTB 下分配独立通道与速率上限。\n与 IP 集合协同：对外访问仍基于 ipset 管理名单；对内按进程（cgroup）区分业务类型，实现“谁访问 + 访问哪里”的双维管控。\n命名与映射规范：约定 classid 与 HTB classid 有一致映射（如 0x00010010 -&gt; 1:10），便于运维与审计。\n性能调优建议与注意事项\n队列算法：为 cgroup 对应的类使用 fq_codel 或 cake，降低排队延迟与抖动。\n过滤器优先级：合理设置 prio，确保 cgroup/mark 过滤器早匹配；避免过多 u32 复杂匹配。\n监控与验证：使用 tc -s class/qdisc show 与 iptables -vnL 观察命中计数，定期复核 cgroup.procs 中的进程是否符合预期。\n兼容性：\n需要内核模块支持：sch_htb、sch_fq_codel、cls_fw、cls_cgroup、xt_set、xt_cgroup。\ncgroup v2 环境建议评估 BPF 方案（tc qdisc add dev eth0 clsact + tc filter add ... bpf），实现更灵活的按进程/Socket 分类。\n持久化：将 cgroup 挂载、classid 设置与 tc/iptables 规则固化为开机脚本或 systemd unit，确保重启后生效。\n安全与隔离：严格控制写入 cgroup.procs 的权限，防止误归类；为高风险作业单独 cgroup 并限制资源上限（CPU/IO 也可结合）。\n注意事项与排查\n操作前备份与回滚\n备份规则：\n恢复规则：\n持久化方法（随发行版而异）\nDebian/Ubuntu：安装 iptables-persistent 或 netfilter-persistent，保存于 /etc/iptables/rules.v4、/etc/ipset.conf\nRHEL/CentOS：使用 service iptables save 或结合 firewalld/nftables 转写；注意 iptables-nft 与 iptables-legacy 差异\ntc：通常以脚本（systemd unit）在启动时应用，或借助 NetworkManager/ifup 触发\n常见问题排查\n标记未生效：检查 mangle 表规则计数；确认 MARK 置位在 PREROUTING/OUTPUT 的正确方向\ntc 过滤无匹配：确认 fw filter handle 与 iptables 标记一致；检查过滤器挂载的设备（egress 对应出口设备）\n入口限速未起效：是否使用 ifb 重定向；ingress qdisc 默认只统计不整形\nnftables 兼容：现代系统默认 iptables-nft，语义兼容但内部实现不同；大规模规则建议评估直接迁移到 nftables\n总结\n使用 ipset 管理名单，iptables 做准入与打标，tc

以上。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;流量控制(tc)是一个非常有用的 Linux 实用程序，它使您能够配置内核数据包调度程序。如果您正在寻找扰乱内核调度器的原因，或者仅仅是测试数据包丢失对应用程序的影响，以下就是其中的一些原因。首先，使用不同的选项并熟悉 Linux 的所有特性是很有趣的。此外，您可以利用 Linux 的有用工具来模拟 UDP 或 TCP 应用程序的数据包延迟和丢失，或者限制特定服务的带宽使用来模拟 Internet 连接(DSL、 Cable、 T1等)。\n原理\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux操作系统中的流量控制器TC（Traffic Control）用于Linux内核的流量控制，主要是通过在输出端口处建立一个队列来实现流量控制。\n接收包从输入接口进来后，经过流量限制丢弃不符合规定的数据包，由输入多路分配器进行判断选择：\n如果接收包的目的主机是本主机，那么将该包送给上层处理，否则需要进行转发，将接收包交到转发块（Forwarding Block）处理。\n转发块同时也接收本主机上层(TCP、UDP等)产生的包，通过查看路由表，决定所处理包的下一跳。\n然后，对包进行排列以便将它们送到输出接口。\n一般只能限制网卡发送的数据包，不能限制网卡接收的数据包，所以可以通过改变发送次序来控制传输速率。\nLinux流量控制主要是在输出接口排列时进行处理和实现的。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linux 中的 QoS 分为入口 (Ingress) 部分和出口 (Egress) 部分，入口部分主要用于进行入口流量限速 (Policing)，出口部分主要用于队列调度 (Queuing Scheduling)。大多数排队规则 (qdisc) 都是用于输出方向的，输入方向只有一个排队规则，即 Ingress qdisc。\nIngress qdisc 本身的功能很有限，输入方向只有一个排队规则，即 Ingress qdisc（因为没有缓存只能实现流量的 Drop）但可用于重定向 Incoming packets。通过 Ingress qdisc 把输入方向的数据包重定向到虚拟设备ifb，而ifb的输出方向可以配置多种 qdisc，就可以达到对输入方向的流量做队列调度的目的。\nIngress\nIngress 限速只能对整个网卡入流量限速，无队列之分。\nIngress 流量的限速示例：\nEgress\nTC模块利用队列规定建立处理数据包的队列，并定义队列中的数据包被发送的方式，实现对流量的控制。\nTC模块实现流量控制功能使用的队列规定分为两类，一类是无类队列规定，另一类是分类队列规定。无类队列规定相对简单，而分类队列规定则引出了分类和过滤器等概念，使其流量控制功能增强。\n无类队列： 规定是对进入网络设备（网卡）的数据流不加区分统一对待的队列规定。使用无类队列规定形成的队列能够接收数据包以及重新编排、延迟或丢弃数据包。这类队列规定形成的队列可以对整个网络设备（网卡）的流量进行整形，但不能细分各种情况。常用的无类队列规定主要有 pfifo_fast（先进先出）、TBF（令牌桶过滤器）、SFQ（随机公平队列）、ID（前向随机丢包）等等。这类队列规定使用的流量整形手段主要是排序、限速和丢包。\n分类队列： 规定是对进入网络设备的数据包根据不同的需求以分类的方式区分对待的队列规定。数据包进入一个分类的队列后，它就需要被送到某一个类中，也就是说需要对数据包做分类处理。对数据包进行分类的工具是过滤器，过滤器会返回一个决定，队列规定就根据这个决定把数据包送入相应的类进行排队。每个子类都可以再次使用它们的过滤器进行进一步的分类。直到不需要进一步分类时，数据包才进入该类包含的队列排队。除了能够包含其他队列规定之外，绝大多数分类的队列规定还能够对流量进行整形。这对于需要同时进行调度（如使用SFQ）和流量控制的场合非常有用。\n基本概念\nQDISC（排队规则）\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;全称是queueing discipline，我们姑且称其为排队规则吧。它是协议栈和网络接口之间的一个缓冲层。你可以在qdisc上对数据包做一些你想做的操作，比如分类、整形、调度等。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;qdisc分为无类（classless）qdisc和有类（classful）qdisc。无类qdisc不再内部细分类，有类qdisc可进一步包含多个分类，每个class上可以进一步包含子qdisc，子qdisc也可以是有类qdisc，这样就形成了树状的分层结构。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;最简单的QDisc是pfifo它不对进入的数据包做任何的处理，数据包采用先入先出的方式通过队列。不过，它会保存网络接口一时无法处理的数据包。\nCLASSLESS QDISC(不可分类QDISC)**\n[p|b]fifo: 使用最简单的qdisc，纯粹的先进先出。只有一个参数：limit，用来设置队列的长度,pfifo是以数据包的个数为单位；bfifo是以字节数为单位。\npfifo_fast: 在编译内核时，如果打开了高级路由器(Advanced Router)编译选项，pfifo_fast就是系统的标准QDISC。它的队列包括三个波段(band)。在每个波段里面，使用先进先出规则。而三个波段(band)的优先级也不相同，band 0的优先级最高，band 2的最低。如果band0里面有数据包，系统就不会处理band 1里面的数据包，band 1和band 2之间也是一样。数据包是按照服务类型(Type of Service,TOS)被分配多三个波段(band)里面的。\nred: Random Early Detection(随机早期探测)的简写。如果使用这种QDISC，当带宽的占用接近于规定的带宽时，系统会随机地丢弃一些数据包。它非常适合高带宽应用。\nsfq: Stochastic Fairness Queueing的简写。它按照会话(session–对应于每个TCP连接或者UDP流)为流量进行排序，然后循环发送每个会话的数据包。\ntbf: Token Bucket Filter的简写，适合于把流速降低到某个值。\n不可分类QDISC配置： 如果没有可分类QDISC，不可分类QDISC只能附属于设备的根。它们的用法如下：\n一个网络接口上如果没有设置QDISC，pfifo_fast就作为缺省的QDISC。\nCLASSFUL QDISC(分类QDISC)\nCBQ： CBQ是Class Based Queueing(基于类别排队)的缩写。它实现了一个丰富的连接共享类别结构，既有限制(shaping)带宽的能力，也具有带宽优先级管理的能力。带宽限制是通过计算连接的空闲时间完成的。空闲时间的计算标准是数据包离队事件的频率和下层连接(数据链路层)的带宽。\nHTB： HTB是Hierarchy Token Bucket的缩写。通过在实践基础上的改进，它实现了一个丰富的连接共享类别体系。使用HTB可以很容易地保证每个类别的带宽，它也允许特定的类可以突破带宽上限，占用别的类的带宽。HTB可以通过TBF(Token Bucket Filter)实现带宽限制，也能够划分类别的优先级。\nPRIO： PRIO QDISC不能限制带宽，因为属于不同类别的数据包是顺序离队的。使用PRIO QDISC可以很容易对流量进行优先级管理，只有属于高优先级类别的数据包全部发送完毕，才会发送属于低优先级类别的数据包。为了方便管理，需要使用iptables或者ipchains处理数据包的服务类型(Type Of Service,ToS)。\nCLASS（类别）\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;有类qdisc可以有多个子类（class），有些qdisc预定义了子类（如prio），有些则需要用户添加类。一个类上又可以附加其他类。最末端没有子类的类称为叶子类，它上面附加了一个qdisc。当创建一个class的时候，默认会附加一个fifo qdisc，它只是一个简单的队列，不对数据包进行任何的操作。当在这个类上增加子类的时候，这个默认的qdisc被移除。你可以将这个默认的fifo qdisc替换成其他任意你想用的qdisc。\neg:\n以上3个是TC中最基本的3个概念，任何复杂的流量控制都是通过这个三元组递归实现的。\n层级结构\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;每个接口有一个egress ‘root qdisc’，默认是pfifo_fast。每个qdisc和class都分配一个句柄handle，句柄用于在后续的配置语句中进行引用。除了egress qdisc，一个接口也可以有一个ingress qdisc，负责管制入站的流量。但是ingress qdisc相比classful qdisc其可能性是非常有限。（所以才有所谓的控发不控收，对入站流量进行控制通常需要借助ifb[6]或者imq）。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;这些qdisc的handles有两个部分组成，一个major数和一个minor数：&lt;major&gt;:&lt;minor&gt;。习惯上将root qdisc命名为1:，等价于1:0。一个qdisc的minor数总是0。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;子类需要跟它们的parent有相同的major数。major数在一个egress或ingress内必须是唯一的，minor数在一个qdisc和它的class中必须是唯一的。\n一个典型的层级结构如下：\n内核只跟root qdisc进行通信，每当包需要入队或者出队的时候，都需要从root节点开始，最终到达叶子节点，从而决定入队到哪里，或者从哪里出队。\n比如当一个包入队时，它可能会经过如下路径：1: -&gt; 1:1 -&gt; 1:12 -&gt; 12: -&gt; 12:2\n当然也可能直接走如下路径：1: -&gt; 12:2\n这种情况，就是root qdisc上的过滤器决定把包直接送到12:2。\n注意：入队和出队时虽然节点的拓扑图是一样的，但是每个节点表示的含义却有所不同*(数据包的分类和调度-Linux TC的另一种解释_可编程数据包调度)*。入队时是根据过滤器和包的特征决定走哪条路径，而出队时则取决于qdisc本身的调度算法，比如FIFO、优先级队列、SFQ的顺序调度等。\nFILTER（过滤器）\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;过滤器，用于有类qdisc中，决定将包入队到哪个类中。每当一个包到达有子类的类时，就需要进行分类。其中一种分类的方法就是使用过滤器（另外两个是ToS和skb-&gt;priority）。所有附加到类上的过滤器会被依次调用，直到其中一个返回裁决。一个filter包含了一些条件，当一个包到达该节点时，会根据包的特征判断是否匹配。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;前面已经提到了过滤器用于将包分类到子类，那么具体是如何对包进行分类的呢？tc支持很多类型的分类器，它们根据数据包相关的不同信息来作出决策。其中最常用的就是u32分类器，它根据数据包中的字段做出决策（例如源IP地址等）。还有比如fw分类器，根据防火墙如何标记数据包来做出决策，你可以使用iptables标记目标数据包，然后通过fw分类器进行过滤。另外还有诸如route分类器、cgroup分类器、bpf分类器等，篇幅原因不再赘述。下面仅介绍最常见的u32分类器。\n公共参数\n分类器一般接收以下几个公共的参数：\nprotocol：分类器接受的协议，通常你只接受IP流量。必须。\nparent：分类器附加到哪个handle上。这个handle必须是一个已经存在的类。必须。\nprio|perf：分类器的优先级。数字越小的越先进行匹配尝试。\nhandle：这个handle对于不同的过滤器表示不同的含义。\nu32分离器 tc-u32(8) - Linux manual page\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;u32过滤器最简单的格式是设置一组选择器对包进行匹配，匹配的包分到特定的子类中，或者执行一个action。u32分类器提供了多种不同的选择器，可以大致分成特殊选择器和通用选择器两类。\n特殊选择器\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;常用的有ip选择器和tcp选择器。特殊选择器简化了一些常用字段的设置，可以匹配包头中的各种字段，比如：\n通用选择器\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;特殊选择器总是可以改写成对应的通用选择器，通用选择器可以匹配 IP（或上层）头中的几乎任何位，不过相比特殊选择器较难编写和阅读。其语法如下：\n其中u32|u16|u8指定pattern的长度，分别为4个字节、2个字节、1个字节。PATTERN表示匹配的包的pattern，MASK告诉过滤器匹配哪些位，at表示从包的指定偏移处开始匹配。\n来看一个例子：\n选择器会匹配IP头第二个字节为0x10的包，at 0表示从头开始匹配，mask为00ff0000所以只匹配第二个字节，pattern为00100000即第二个字节为0x10。\n再来看另一个例子：\nnexthdr选项表示封装在IP包里的下一个头，即上层协议的头。at nexthdr+0表示从下一个头第一个字节开始匹配。因为mask为0000ffff，所以匹配发生在头的第三和第四个字节。在TCP和UDP协议中这两个字节是包的目的端口。数字是由大段格式给出的，所以pattern&nbsp;00000016转换成十进制是22。即该选择器会匹配目的端口为22的包。\n示例\n示例一\n我们一行行来看，第一行在设备eth0上添加了一个root qdisc，句柄为1:，qdisc类型为prio，bands数为4。\nprio是一个有类的qdisc。它的作用跟默认的qdisc pfifo_fast类似。pfifo_fast有三个所谓的band，不同band的流量具有不同的优先级。每个band内，则应用FIFO规则。\nprio qdisc，默认会创建3个子类，包含纯FIFO qdisc，默认根据ToS位进行分类。你可以使用过滤器来对流量进行分类，你也可以在子类上附加其他qdisc替换默认的FIFO。\n接下来看第二个命令，parent 1:4表示在子类1:4上，handle 40:表示句柄为40:，netem表示添加一个netem qdisc，loss 10% delay 40ms则是netem的参数，表示丢包10%、延迟40ms。networking:netem是一个用于提供网络仿真功能的无类qdisc，可以模拟延迟、丢包、包重复、包失序等各种情况。\n第三个命令则是添加了一个过滤器，parent 1:0表示在根节点上添加该过滤器，prio 4是过滤器的优先级，如果有很多过滤器会根据优先级的值按顺序进行尝试。u32表示使用u32分类器。match ip dst 192.168.190.7表示匹配ip地址为192.168.190.7的包，match ip dport 36000 0xffff表示匹配目的端口为36000的包，多个选择器之间是“与”的关系，flowid 1:4表示将匹配的包分类到1:4子类中。\n所以最终的效果是，发往192.168.190.7且目的端口为36000的包，会分类到1:4子类，添加40ms的延迟，且有10%的丢包率。其他包则还是默认的行为，即根据ToS字段分类到1:1、1:2或1:3子类中，然后根据优先级依次发送。\n画出该例子的分层结构图，大致如下：\n示例二\nNOTE: enp0s5 为网卡名，真实实验需要替换为自己的网卡名；\n示例三\nNetwork Delay\nqdisc: modify the scheduler (aka queuing discipline)\nadd: add a new rule\ndev eth0: rules will be applied on device eth0\nroot: modify the outbound traffic scheduler (aka known as the egress qdisc)\nnetem: use the network emulator to emulate a WAN property\ndelay: the network property that is modified\n200ms: introduce delay of 200 ms\nNote that if you have an existing rule you can change it by using “tc qdisc change” and if you don’t have any rules you add rules with “tc qdisc add”.

+ 垄断 + 成瘾”黄金三角：选股铁律。选择大行业（如消费、健康）中具有垄断地位（定价权、无竞争对手）的公司，产品需具备成瘾性（重复消费、刚需）。例如，白酒（如茅台）满足“成瘾+垄断”，医药（如慢性病药物）满足“行业增长+刚需”。远离竞争激烈的领域，拥抱“闭着眼睛都能赚钱”的企业。\n“嘴巴生意”与大健康导向：以人为本，聚焦人类基本需求。看好“嘴巴相关”（食品饮料、酒类）和“老人经济”（老龄化驱动的大健康，如糖尿病、心脏病、高血压药物）。从人口结构看，2024年中国65岁及以上人口约2.20亿、占比15.6%（国家统计局，2025-01-17），到2050年预计增至约3.6亿、占比约26%—30%（联合国《世界人口展望2024修订》；Peking University–Lancet 委员会报告）。需求侧的长期扩张为医药与健康相关消费提供持续的确定性（数据来源见文末“引用与资料来源”）。强调情绪价值（如白酒的“小酌怡情”）在AI时代更稀缺。\n长期持有与复利效应：赚“长期的钱、成长的钱、正道的钱”。买了不卖，终身持有优秀公司，让时间和复利制造财富。优质股票如“金子”，价格下跌也不卖；伟大企业的收益会迟到但不会缺席。分散投资导致平庸，重仓集中于少数确定性标的（平均持有超6年）。\n前瞻性与风险控制：赚未来的钱，看人口趋势与基本面数据（如老龄化带来的医疗与护理需求增量）。风险在源头规避，通过调研（每月跟踪重仓公司）和能力圈限制（不投科技、券商）。以股息率与现金流折现为估值抓手，当股息率显著高于长期无风险收益率区间时加仓（如近年10年期国债收益率约2%—3%的环境中，持续现金分红的高股息公司更具吸引力）。坚持“不择时、不卖出”的长期主义。\n人性与心理管理：投资像龟兔赛跑，孤独但靠时间取胜。第一个100万难赚，改变命运需15年（前11-12年可能无感）。抵抗贪婪，避免中途变卦；出资人与管理人互相选择，但合同绑定。股市如“骗子”，需坚守常识，不信“市梦率”。\n这些思想在王洪的书籍中被系统化呈现：《林园炒股秘籍》聚焦实战案例和分红复利；《复合增长》强调复利、垄断与成瘾；《激荡投资30年》回顾熊牛更替，剖析投机智慧与价值融合。\n最近30年的投资实操指南（1995-2025）\n基于林园的投资思想，这份指南模拟其风格应用于中国股市过去30年（从早期发展到2025年成熟阶段）。中国股市经历了多轮牛熊转换：1995-2000年基础建设期、2001-2005年熊市、2006-2007年大牛市、2008年金融危机、2009-2014年波动、2015年股灾、2016-2020年结构性行情、2021-2022年调整、2023-2025年政策驱动反弹。林园风格强调不择时、长期持有，聚焦确定性刚需领域，避免泡沫。指南分为通用原则和分阶段操作，使用表格呈现关键点。\n通用原则\n选股：筛选“行业+垄断+成瘾”标的。优先医药（慢性病药）、白酒（高端龙头）、食品（必需消费）。调研每月进行，关注经销商和竞争对手。财务门槛：毛利率&gt;50%、ROE&gt;15%、分红率&gt;长期债利率。\n建仓与持有：低估值时分批建仓（3-10年过程），买了不卖。重仓比例70%以上于核心标的，利用复利滚雪球。\n风险控制：能力圈内操作，不投科技/新能源。市场下跌视作机会，股息率&gt;5%时加仓。心理管理：15年为周期，熬过前10年无感期。\n退出：极少卖出，仅当公司垄断地位丧失或需求趋势逆转。赚取复合增长，非短期波动。\n普通投资者建议：资产多元化但集中核心，终身持有分红股。相信需求端（如老龄化），忽略政策噪音。\n分阶段实操指南\n以下表格按时间段划分，列出基于林园思想的建议投资重点、关键行动和历史验证（参考其实际持仓如茅台、五粮液、中药股）。\n时间段市场背景投资重点（林园风格）关键行动历史验证与教训\n1995-2000：早期市场发展，国企改革启动股市基础建设，波动大，蓝筹初现。基础消费与医药刚需，如早期白酒（贵州茅台上市前布局）和中药股。聚焦“嘴巴生意”起步。以小资金试水，选垄断初现公司（如区域性消费品）。建仓期3-5年，观察需求增长。林园早期波段深发展获利，后转向价值。教训：避开投机股，转向确定性，避免1997亚洲危机损失。\n2001-2005：熊市调整，入世后经济转型长期熊市，估值低迷，供给过剩。加仓高股息消费股，如白酒和慢性病药。利用低估值建安全垫。不卖出，视下跌为机会。调研人口需求（如老龄化初期）。林园避开熊市，持有白酒类获复利。教训：分散不如集中，2005年转牛前重仓改变命运。\n2006-2010：大牛市后金融危机2006-07牛市泡沫，2008全球危机，2009刺激反弹。重仓白酒（如茅台、五粮液）和医药（如心脏病药）。避开地产/金融泡沫。牛市不追高，危机中加仓垄断股。持有穿越熊牛。林园2006成立机构，重仓消费获丰厚回报。教训：2008不卖，复利放大收益；科技泡沫易爆。\n2011-2015：波动与股灾结构性行情，2015杠杆牛后股灾。深化大健康布局，如糖尿病/高血压药。补充养老相关股。股灾不慌，视作加仓时。强调成瘾性消费。林园持仓穿越股灾，医药股需求刚性护盘。教训：杠杆放大风险，确定性胜过投机。\n2016-2020：结构性牛市，疫情冲击白马股崛起，2020疫情后医药爆发。加大老人经济投资，如肾透析/辅助生殖。白酒作为核心配置。疫情中调研需求爆发，终身持有。林园看好老龄化，医药股翻倍。教训：避开新能源泡沫，专注刚需。\n2021-2025：调整后政策反弹2021-22调整，2023-25政策刺激，高股息流行。70%仓位重仓老龄化医药（如三大病相关），白酒辅助。看好分红率&gt;6%股。当前牛市起点（4000点仅上半场），不卖，加仓便宜资产。调研未来趋势（如孩子稀缺）。林园视2025为转折年，医药需求增10倍。教训：乐观持有，2026迎全面牛市。\n此指南非林园本人直接输出，而是基于其思想的提炼应用。实际操作需结合个人风险承受力，建议调研最新数据。林园强调：投资是马拉松，15年为门槛，成功源于坚持确定性而非运气。\n未来30年的投资实操指南（2026-2055）\n基于林园的投资思想，这份指南延伸其对未来趋势的预判，特别是人口老龄化作为最大确定性机会，推动大健康和“嘴巴生意”领域的长期增长。中国人口老龄化将加速：到2050年，65岁及以上人口预计约3.6—3.95亿，占比约26%—30%（联合国《世界人口展望2024修订》；Peking

与幂等写。\nKafka：Broker 多副本+ISR，控制器自动选举；跨机房可启用 MirrorMaker2。\nFlink：Checkpoint+Savepoint，RocksDB 状态后端，事务性 Sink（两阶段提交）。\nElasticsearch：索引副本与 ILM 滚动；跨集群搜索可做容灾；\nClickHouse：分片+副本，ReplicatedMergeTree，失败节点自动恢复；\nHBase：HDFS 冗余、RegionServer 自动迁移，ZK 保证一致性。\n2. 技术选型分析\n选择考量与对比\nFilebeat vs Fluent Bit：生态与可维护性、配置一致性；FB 多模块成熟，FB→Kafka 链路稳定。\nKafka vs Pulsar：Kafka 在日志生态与 Flink Source 上成熟；事务性写与生态工具完备。\nFlink vs Spark Streaming：更低延迟与原生事件时间，Exactly-Once 更易实现。\nES vs OpenSearch：社区与商业支持综合评估；选 ES 8.x 以简化部署与安全集成。\nClickHouse vs Druid：写入吞吐与查询延迟综合更优，维护成本低；\nHBase vs Cassandra：基于 HDFS 的生态整合与线性扩展、适合明细长保留。\n版本建议与兼容性\nKafka 3.x（带 KRaft 或 ZK）、Flink ≥1.17、ES 8.x、ClickHouse ≥23.x、HBase 2.x、JDK 17。\n序列化：JSON 起步，推荐 Avro/Protobuf+Schema

示例）\nElasticsearch 索引与分片\nClickHouse 表设计\nHBase RowKey 与列族\n日志采集模块配置（容器与主机）\n容器环境日志采集\n采集 Docker 标准输出（stdout/stderr）\n方法 A（文件采集）：Docker 默认 json-file 驱动将容器日志写入 /var/lib/docker/containers/&lt;cid&gt;/&lt;cid&gt;-json.log。\n方法 B（容器输入）：使用 type: container 读取容器运行时日志（支持 Docker/Containerd CRI），适合 K8s。\n容器日志文件挂载采集\n为 Filebeat 容器挂载主机日志目录与 Docker/K8s 元数据接口：\nDocker：挂载 /var/lib/docker/containers 与 /var/run/docker.sock\nK8s：挂载 /var/log/containers、/var/log/pods、/var/lib/docker/containers（取决于运行时）\nKubernetes DaemonSet 部署示例\n容器元数据增强\nDocker：add_docker_metadata 通过 Docker API 提取容器名、镜像、标签等；\nKubernetes：add_kubernetes_metadata 注入 Pod/Namespace/Labels/Annotations；可用 drop_event/drop_fields 做过滤与瘦身。\n主机环境日志采集\n采集系统日志（syslog/auth/journald）\n使用系统模块（推荐）：\n或文件输入（通用）：\n主机标签与自定义字段\n使用 fields 与 fields_under_root: true 直接展开到事件根，提高检索友好性；配合 tags: [prod, region-cn] 标注环境。\n日志轮转与归档建议\n应用侧启用 logrotate 或等效机制，控制单文件大小与保留周期；\nFilebeat 相关参数：\nclose_inactive: 5m（无新数据关闭文件句柄）\nclean_inactive: 168h（长时间无活动的文件从注册表清理）\nignore_older: 24h（忽略过久文件）\nscan_frequency: 10s（扫描新文件频率）\n通用配置要求\n完整的 filebeat.yml 示例（容器与主机通用骨架）\n过滤与字段处理\n首选在采集侧做降噪：drop_event、drop_fields、dissect/decode_json_fields、rename；\n统一时间戳：timestamp 处理器将自定义时间字段映射到 @timestamp。\nKafka 输出参数说明\nrequired_acks=-1（all ISR 确认）、compression=lz4、max_message_bytes 控制单消息大小；\npartition.round_robin.reachable_only=true 避免不可达分区；client_id 标识采集实例；\n安全：SASL SCRAM 与 SSL 证书链；生产环境建议启用加密与认证。\n性能与安全建议\n控制输入文件数量与 harvester_limit，避免句柄耗尽；\n合理 bulk_max_size 与 Kafka 端 linger.ms/batch.size 匹配；\n采集侧最小权限运行，限制可读取路径；容器中避免特权运行。\n验证方案\n功能验证\n本地：filebeat test output 检查与 Kafka 的连通；filebeat -e -d \"publish\" 观察事件发送；\n端到端：使用 kcat -C -b kafka1:9092 -t logs.raw -o -10 拉取最新评论，校验字段；\n常见问题排查\n容器元数据缺失：检查是否挂载 /var/run/docker.sock 或正确配置 add_kubernetes_metadata；\n多行合并异常：确认 multiline.pattern 与日志格式匹配，适当调整 timeout；\n无法读取文件：校验路径与权限，确认 Filebeat 运行用户与宿主机挂载；\nKafka 429/缓慢：检查 required_acks、网络与批量参数，监控 broker 队列与磁盘；\n性能监控配置建议\n启用 http.enabled: true 暴露指标（/stats），采集 beat.events、harvester.open_files、output.events 成功/失败；\n用 Prometheus 抓取并设置告警：采集速率低于预期、发送失败率升高、打开文件数异常增长。\n4. 性能优化经验\nFilebeat：bulk_max_size 调整批量；启用持久队列；过滤低价值日志降低链路压力。\nKafka：合适分区数与 RF；Broker num.network.threads/socket.send.buffer.bytes；启用 LZ4；控制批大小与 linger。\nFlink：优化并行度与算子链；RocksDB state、增大 write-buffer-size；Checkpoint 间隔与超时合理化。\nES：降低刷新频率（5-10s）、增大 indexing.buffer、合理分片；使用 ILM 滚动与冷/温节点。\nCH：控制 parts 数量，批量写入；max_insert_block_size、max_threads 调优；后台合并监控。\nHBase：RowKey 防热点；memstore/blockcache 调整；Major/Minor compaction 节奏。\n容量规划：按峰值吞吐与增长率规划分区/分片/Region 数量，留有 30% 余量。\n5. 运维监控方案\n指标\nFilebeat：harvesters、publish queue 使用率、掉包率。\nKafka：ISR、Under-Replicated Partitions、Consumer Lag、请求队列长度。\nFlink：Backpressure、Checkpoint Time/Fail、Task Failures。\nES：JVM heap、GC、Indexing rate、Query p95/p99、Threadpool 队列。\nCH：parts 数、后台 merges、replication lag、查询耗时分布。\nHBase：RegionServer 负载、Compaction、读写延迟。\n告警阈值示例（PromQL）\n运维清单：滚动升级、备份与快照、容量巡检、索引与表维护、Checkpoint 与 Savepoint 验证。\n6. 实际应用案例（示例）\n规模：日均 2TB，峰值 250k events/s；端到端 p95 ≤ 500ms。\n查询：ES 关键词检索 p95 ≤ 200ms；CH 1 亿行聚合 p95 ≤ 2s。\n价值：统一日志入口、降低故障定位时间 ≥50%，支持审计与增长分析。\n7. 部署脚本示例（片段）\n8. 典型问题与解决\nKafka 负载不均：分区键散列不均导致热点 → 优化 Key 与增加分区。\nFlink Checkpoint 失败：外部存储带宽不足 → 升级存储与拉长间隔、压缩状态。\nES 写入 429：线程池队列满 → 降低刷新频率、调大 bulk、限流入口。\nCH parts 过多：小批次写导致合并压力 → 增大批次与控制并发。\nHBase 热点 Region：RowKey 顺序导致集中 → 前缀散列或反转时间戳。\n9. 对比传统方案的改进\n相比仅 ELK：引入 Kafka 与 Flink 实现解耦与实时计算；ClickHouse/HBase 提供高效分析与长期明细，整体可用性与扩展性更佳。\n10. 架构演进方向\nSchema Registry+Avro/Protobuf；Kafka 分层存储；Flink Stateful Functions；ES 冷/温节点与 CCR；ClickHouse 对象存储分层；HBase 与 Data

为什么我们需要现代分配器？\n在单核时代，内存分配主要关注的是“如何找到一块大小合适的空闲内存”以及“如何减少碎片”。但在多核高并发时代，锁竞争（Lock Contention） 成为了性能杀手。\nptmalloc 虽然引入了 per-thread arenas 来减少竞争，但在极高并发下，频繁的锁操作和缓存一致性流量（Cache Coherence Traffic）依然会导致显著的性能下降。此外，随着内存容量的增加，内存碎片（Fragmentation）带来的空间浪费成本也越来越高。\n现代分配器（Modern Allocators）通常致力于解决以下三个核心问题：\n多线程扩展性：在分配和释放的“快路径”上尽可能做到无锁（Lock-free）。\n缓存局部性（Cache Locality）：让连续分配的对象在物理内存上也尽可能连续，提高 CPU 缓存命中率。\n内存利用率：通过精细的 Size Class 划分和及时的内存归还策略，降低碎片率和 RSS（Resident Set Size）。\n2. 核心设计策略\n尽管 jemalloc、tcmalloc 和 mimalloc 的具体实现细节不同，但它们在宏观架构上惊人地相似。我们可以将其归纳为以下几个通用策略：\n2.1 Thread Local Cache (TLC) —— 消除锁竞争\n这是现代分配器最重要的优化手段。每个线程都维护一份私有的缓存（Thread Local Cache），用于满足绝大多数的小对象分配需求。\n分配（Malloc）：线程直接从自己的 TLC 中获取内存块，无需加锁，仅需简单的指针操作。这是“快路径”。\n释放（Free）：如果对象属于当前线程管理，直接放回 TLC，同样无需加锁。\n只有当 TLC 耗尽（需要从全局获取）或 TLC 塞满（需要归还给全局）时，才会进入“慢路径”，涉及到全局锁或原子操作。\n2.2 Size Classes —— 隔离与对齐\n为了避免外碎片（External Fragmentation）并简化管理，分配器不会按用户请求的任意字节数分配，而是将大小向上取整到最近的 Size Class。\n例如，请求 12 字节，可能会分配 16 字节（属于 16-byte class）；请求 40 字节，分配 48 字节。\nSegregated Free Lists（隔离空闲链表）：每个 Size Class 都有自己独立的空闲链表。分配时只需从对应链表头部取下一个节点即可，复杂度为 O(1)。\n减少元数据开销：同属一个 Page/Block 的对象通常大小相同，因此不需要在每个对象头部存储大小信息（Header），通过地址偏移即可计算出所属的 Size Class。\n2.3 多级缓存架构 (Hierarchical Caching)\n为了在“独占”与“共享”之间取得平衡，现代分配器通常采用三级架构：\nThread Local Cache：第一级，完全无锁，速度最快。\nCentral Cache / Arena：第二级，共享资源。当 TLC 不足时，从这里批量获取对象；当 TLC 过大时，将对象批量归还于此。通常需要加锁（或使用细粒度锁）。\nPage Heap：第三级，直接管理操作系统的大块内存（Pages/Spans）。当 Central Cache 不足时，向 Page Heap 申请新的页；当内存长期空闲时，将页归还给 OS。\n2.4 Page 管理与 Span\n分配器通常以 Page（通常是 4KB 或更大）的倍数向 OS 申请内存。多个连续的 Page 组成一个 Span（或 Run）。\n一个 Span 通常被切割成多个相同大小的小对象（属于同一个 Size Class）。这种设计使得分配器可以很容易地判断一个指针属于哪个 Span，进而知道它的大小和状态。\n3. 主流分配器案例分析\n3.1 tcmalloc (Google)\ntcmalloc (Thread-Caching Malloc) 是现代分配器架构的奠基者之一。\n架构：Thread Cache -&gt; Central Cache -&gt; Page Heap。\n特点：\n小对象：通过 Thread Cache 分配，无锁。\n中对象：直接从 Page Heap 分配 Span。\nSpan 管理：使用 Radix Tree 将地址映射到 Span 元数据，查找速度快。\n优势：非常适合多线程环境，性能稳定，被广泛用于 C++ 服务端开发。\n3.2 jemalloc (FreeBSD, Facebook)\njemalloc 最初为 FreeBSD 开发，后被 Firefox、Facebook、Rust（曾用）等广泛采用。它在减少内存碎片方面表现优异。\n核心概念：\nArena：为了减少锁竞争，jemalloc 将内存划分为多个 Arena，每个线程绑定一个 Arena。\nChunk/Run/Region：内存分层管理。Chunk 是大块内存，Run 是 Chunk 中的一部分，Region 是分配给用户的小对象。\nDecay：jemalloc 有非常智能的脏页清理（Decay）机制，能够平滑地将不再使用的 dirty pages 归还给 OS，避免 RSS 暴涨。\n优势：在长时间运行的服务中，内存碎片控制得非常好，且具备强大的 Profiling 功能（jeprof）。\n3.3 mimalloc (Microsoft)\nmimalloc 是微软研究院推出的新一代分配器，以极致的性能和安全性著称。\n创新点：\nFree List Sharding：它不仅有 Thread Local allocation，还支持 Thread Local free。即使是其他线程释放了当前线程分配的内存，也不会产生复杂的锁竞争，而是放入一个特定的“分片”队列中。\nMimalloc Pages：它将 Page 的元数据直接存储在 Page 的头部，利用对齐特性快速访问，减少了 cache miss。\n优势：在许多 benchmark 中性能超越 jemalloc 和 tcmalloc，且代码库相对精简，易于集成。\n4. 快速上手 Demo\n大多数情况下，使用这些现代分配器不需要修改任何业务代码。你只需要在编译时链接相应的库，或者在运行时通过 LD_PRELOAD 环境变量进行替换即可。\n以下是一个简单的 C++ 测试程序 main.cpp，我们将用它来演示如何切换不同的分配器：\n4.1 使用 tcmalloc (gperftools)\n安装：\n运行方式 1：LD_PRELOAD (无需重新编译)\n运行方式 2：编译链接\n4.2 使用 jemalloc\n安装：\n运行方式 1：LD_PRELOAD\n运行方式 2：编译链接\n进阶：打印内存统计信息\njemalloc 提供了强大的自省功能。你可以在代码中调用 malloc_stats_print（需要包含 &lt;jemalloc/jemalloc.h&gt; 并链接库）：\n4.3 使用 mimalloc\n安装：\n运行方式 1：LD_PRELOAD\n运行方式 2：编译链接\n5. 总结与选型建议\n特性glibc

大型系统的稳健之选。\n理解这些底层策略，不仅有助于我们选择合适的库，更能帮助我们在编写高性能代码时，更有意识地规划内存的使用模式。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/modern-malloc-core-strategies/","title":"现代 malloc

(有歧义以原文为主)：\nPacificA：微软设计的分布式存储框架\nPacificA算法分析-腾讯云开发者社区-腾讯云\n系统框架\n整个系统框架主要有两部分组成：存储集群和配置管理集群。\n存储集群：负责系统数据的读取和更新，通过使用多副本方式保证数据可靠性和可用性；\n配置管理集群：维护副本信息，包括副本的参与节点，主副本节点，当前副本的版本等。\n数据被存储在数据分片上，数据分片实际上是数据集合，每个数据分片的大小基本固定，在存储节点上，数据分片表现为磁盘上的一个大文件。而数据分片也是多副本的基本单位。\n配置管理集群维护的其实是分片的副本信息（分片位于哪些节点）。数据分片的副本称之为复制组（Replication Group）。因为每个存储节点上会存在众多的数据分片，因此，每个存储节点会位于多个复制组中。\n配置管理集群维护所有分片的位置信息，配置管理集群使用Paxos协议维护该数据的一致性。存储集群以配置管理集群维护的分片位置信息为准。\n设计目标\nHigh scalability, availability and throughput\nFlexibility and

experiences\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PacificA是一个读写都满足强一致的算法，它通过三个不变式保证了读写的primary的唯一性，读写的强一致性，故障恢复的可靠性。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;它把数据的一致性和配置的一致性分开，使用额外的一致性组件（Configuration Manager）维护配置的一致性，结合lease机制保证了Primary Invariant，使得在同一时刻有且仅有一个primary。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update操作时，要求所有的secondary均prepare当前update，primary commit当前update，保证了Committed Invariant, 使得读操作可以获取到最新数据，primary故障时，secondary也有全量的数据。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;故障恢复机制保证了当secondary被选为primary时，其commit包含之前primary或secondary的commit，保证了Reconfiguration Invariant，使得在故障恢复后数据不会有丢失。\n数据分片\n本地存储设计要点：\nSequential IO\nImmutable files(append)\nEasy to take a snapshot\nEasy to handle failures\nContinue to update the data when we do query\n系统模型和前提条件\nNo

total ordering of all requests yields the same responses that client received, reads must return the committed most up-to-date values\nSequential Consistency\nallows reads to return outdated values\nWeak Read Consistency\nRead can return results of even uncommitted operations\n复制协议\nPrimary/Backup protocol\nTwo-phase protocol\nOne-phase protocol\nPrimary/Backup protocol\nTwo-phase protocol\nPrepared and committed list\npacificA副本数据使用主从式框架来保证数据一致性。分片的多个副本中存在一个主副本Primary和多个从副本Secondary。所有的数据更新和读取都进入主副本，当主副本出现故障无法访问时系统会从其他从副本中选择合适的节点作为新的主。\n在pacificA协议中，每个节点都维护\n数据更新的流程如下：\n更新记录进入主副本节点处理，为该记录分配Sn（Serial Number），然后将该记录插入prepare list，该list上的记录按照sn有序排列；\n主副本节点将携带sn的记录发往从节点，从节点同样将该记录插入到prepare list；\n一旦主节点收到所有从节点的响应，确定该记录已经被正确写入所有的从节点，那就将commit list向前移动，并将这些消息应用到主节点的状态机；\n主节点提交后即可给客户端返回响应，同时向所有从节点发送消息，告诉从节点可以提交刚刚写入的记录了。\n通过上面的分析可以知道，commit list和prepare list必然满足以下条件：\nCommit Invariant: Let p be the primary and q be any replica\nin the current configuration, committed q ⊆ committed p ⊆\nprepared q holds.\n所有的读需要全部发往主节点，这是因为客户端来读时，主节点有可能尚未将commit消息发送至从，因此，如果读从节点可能会无法获取最新数据。当然，如果应用能够忍受一定的窗口，那读从也无所谓。\n想到一个异常情况，当update执行过程中，primary挂掉了，导致更新失败，secondary已经被prepare了update，这时一个secondary被选为新的primary，将其所有的update commit，那之前失败的update操作数据不就出现在了数据中，导致与预期不符？\npacificA算法中一个primary或secondary是一个数据实体，不应该是一个执行实体，所以当primary挂掉后，update任务不会执行失败，而是等待选出新的primary，并在其上commit这个update，保证不会出现数据不一致的情况\nP/B Protocol(Failure Scenarios)\nConfiguration\nBe consisted of primary and several backups\nHas a view number which increases by one each time the configurations changes.\nMaster(God) keeps the authoritative, most up-to-date configurations of all the groups.\npacificA通过契约(lease)的方式来进行primary和secondary间的互相检测。primary会定期(lease period)向各节点请求契约，如果某个节点没有回复，则说明该节点已经故障，primary会向Configuration Manager请求移除该secondary。 如果过了(grace period), 一个secondary没有收到primary的请求，则认为primary故障，该secondary会向Configuration请求移除Primary，并将自己设置为primary。这里要注意\n当多个secondary均发现primary故障，则按照first win原则，先请求的成为primary\n当出现网络分区时，primary会要求剔除secondary， secondary要求剔除primary，但由于lease period&lt; grace period，可以保证primary先于secondary发现故障，并将secondary剔除\n系统运行过程中难免出现节点宕机离线等诸多异常。如何保证在节点异常情况下协议的正常运行是分布式系统设计中的关键问题。pacificA是一种强一致协议，通过主节点来维护多副本数据一致性。因此，需要确保每个副本的唯一主，避免二主问题的发生就非常关键。\npacificA使用了lease机制来保证不会产生二主问题。主节点与从节点维护心跳信息：主节点定期发送心跳，只要从节点响应该心跳，主节点就确定自己还是主。对于以下两种可能的异常：\n如果主节点在一定时间内（lease period）未收到从节点对心跳的回应，那主节点认为从节点异常，于是向配置管理服务汇报更新复制集拓扑，将该异常从节点从复制集中移除，同时，它也将自己降级不再作为主；\n如果从节点在一定时间内（grace period）未收到主节点的心跳信息，那么其认为主节点异常，于是向配置管理服务汇报回信复制集拓扑，将主节点从复制集中移除，同时将自己提升为新的主。\n分析可知，只要lease period &lt;= grace peroid，就不会产生二主问题，因为：\n假如主从之间出现网络分区。只要lease period &lt;= grace peroid，主必然先检测到从没有回复的事件，于是他开始停止作为主服务，并且通知配置管理服务；\n由于lease period &lt;= grace peroid，那么从节点检测到主节点异常则是在主节点停止作为主以后，此时该副本集是不存在主的，因此，必然不会产生二主现象。\n为什么主在检测到从节点异常时需要停止自己作为主的身份?\n如果不这样有可能会出现多主情况。分析一下，主节点不停止自己作为主，继续对外提供更新服务，而直接向配置管理服务汇报从复制集中移除从节点的消息M1，而从节点经过一段时间后向配置管理服务汇报移除主节点并将自己提升为新主的消息M2，但是由于网络传输的不确定性，配置管理服务可能会先处理M2，于是问题来了，这时候就产生了两个主，破坏系统的强一致性。\n使用租约机制保证一致性是众多分布式系统的标准做法，例如GFS、Bigtable等。但是诸如GFS、Bigtable都是从一个集中式服务中申请lease，而pacificA则是一种去中心化式的租约机制。\n另外，主从之间的数据流动也天然发挥了心跳信息的功能，因此，只要主从之间有数据交换，就可以无需发送心跳。\nsecondary故障\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;当一个scondary故障时，primary在向该secondary发送lease请求时会超时，primary向Configuration Manage发送Reconfiguration请求将该secondary从Configuration中移除\nprimary故障\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;当primary故障时， secondary在超过grace period没有收到primary的请求，就会向Configuration Manager发送Reconfiguraiont请求\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;要求将primary从configuration中移除并将自己选为primary。多个secondary竞争成为primary时，遵循first win原则。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;当一个secondary被选为primary后 ,它会向所有的secondary发送prepare请求，要求所有的sencodary均以其pareparedList为准进行对齐，当收到所有secondary的ack后，primary将自己的commit point移动到最后，这个时候primary才能对外提供服务。\n网络分区的场景\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;网络分区场景下，primary认为secondary故障，secondary认为primary故障，但由于lease period小于grace period，所以primary会先与secondary发现故障，并向Congfiguration Manager发送请求移除secondary\n新节点加入\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;新节点加入时，首先会先成为secondary candidate, 然后追平primary的preparedList,然后申请成为secondary。还有一种情况是之前故障的节点恢复加入，这个时候会复用之前的preparedlist并追平secondary的preparedlist, 然后申请成为secondary。\nPrimary Invariant\n在pacificA算法中，要保证primary不变式Primary Invariant，即\n同一个时刻只有一个副本认为自己是primary\nconfiguration Manager也认为其是primary。\n从前面的故障恢复可以看到pacificA算法通过lease（契约）机制保证了这个不变式\nReconfiguration Invariant\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;重新配置不变式：当一个新的primary在T时刻完成reconfiguration,那么T时刻之前任意节点（包括原primary）的committedList都是新的primary当前committedList的前缀。\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;该不变式保证了reconfiguration过程中没有数据丢失，由于update机制保证了任意的sencondary都有所有的数据，而reconfiguration重新选primary要求新的primary commit其所有的prepareList,因此这个不变式可以得到保证。\n参考资料\nhttps://www.zhihu.com/question/59320850/answer/1578135865\nPacificA算法分析-腾讯云开发者社区-腾讯云\nhttps://blog.51cto.com/u_15060462/2649440\nPacificA协议 - holidays -

JavaScript 实现分析\n让我们分析一下 raft-node.js 中的关键部分，看看它们是如何实现 Raft 算法的核心机制的。\n3.1 节点状态管理\n这段代码定义了 Raft 节点的基本状态，包括持久性状态（currentTerm、votedFor、log）和易失性状态（commitIndex、lastApplied、nextIndex、matchIndex）。\n3.2 领导人选举\n这段代码实现了选举过程：节点成为候选人，增加任期号，给自己投票，然后向其他节点请求投票。如果获得多数票，则成为领导人。\n3.3 日志复制\n这段代码实现了日志复制机制：领导人向跟随者发送 AppendEntries RPC，包含要复制的日志条目。跟随者验证请求的有效性，然后更新自己的日志。\n4. 实践演示\nraft-test.js 文件展示了如何创建一个 Raft 集群并测试其功能：\n这段代码创建了 5 个 Raft 节点，让它们相互连接，然后等待领导人选举完成。一旦选出领导人，它会向领导人发送一个客户端请求，然后检查所有节点的日志是否一致。\n5. 总结与思考\n通过对 Raft 算法的学习和 JavaScript 实现的分析，我们可以看到 Raft 算法的几个关键优势：\n可理解性：Raft 将共识问题分解为选举、日志复制和安全性三个子问题，使其更容易理解和实现。\n领导人机制：Raft 使用强领导人模式，所有日志条目都从领导人流向其他服务器，简化了日志复制的管理。\n成员变更：Raft 提供了一种安全的方式来改变集群中的服务器集合。\n日志压缩：Raft 支持日志压缩，防止日志无限增长。\n然而，我们的 JavaScript 实现还有一些局限性和可改进之处：\n网络通信：实际实现中需要使用真正的 RPC 机制，而不是直接函数调用。\n持久化：需要将持久性状态（currentTerm、votedFor、log）写入持久存储。\n错误处理：需要处理网络分区、节点崩溃等故障情况。\n日志压缩：实现日志压缩机制，防止日志无限增长。\n成员变更：实现安全的集群成员变更机制。\nRaft 算法的设计理念是“易于理解“，这使得它成为分布式系统中实现共识的流行选择。通过本文的学习，希望读者能够对 Raft 算法有更深入的理解，并能够在实际项目中应用这些知识。\n完整实现代码：gitee\n参考资料\nGitHub - maemual/raft-zh_cn: Raft一致性算法论文的中文翻译\nRaft 官方网站：https://raft.github.io/\nRaft 可视化：http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/\nRaft算法原理 - codedump的网络日志","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/raft-iml-js/","title":"Raft 共识算法详解与 JavaScript 实现"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/":{"body":"","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/","title":"Redis 源码解读"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/00-redis-source-code-outline/":{"body":"千里之行，始于足下。\nRedis 源码博大精深，为了避免在浩如烟海的代码中迷失方向，制定一个清晰的阅读大纲至关重要。本文作为本系列的“第 0 篇”，旨在规划一条从底层到上层、从单机到集群的学习路径。\n本系列将基于 Redis 7.2 版本源码进行解读。\n🗺️ 整体蓝图\n我们将 Redis 源码阅读分为七个阶段：\n基础篇：万丈高楼平地起，搞懂 Redis 独特的底层数据结构。\n对象篇：理解 Redis 如何在底层结构之上构建出 String, List, Hash 等对外类型。\n核心篇：深入 Redis 的心脏 —— 事件循环与网络模型。\n数据库篇：探索键值对存储、过期策略与内存淘汰。\n持久化篇：RDB 与 AOF 如何保障数据安全。\n分布式篇：主从复制、哨兵与集群的实现原理。\n进阶篇：事务、Lua 脚本、Stream 等高级特性。\n📚 详细大纲 (持续更新)\nPhase 1: 底层数据结构 (The Foundation)\nRedis 为了追求极致性能，造了许多“轮子”。这些数据结构是理解 Redis 的基石。\n[01. 源码地图与环境搭建]({{&lt; ref “01-redis-source-code-map.md” &gt;}})\n源码目录概览\n开发环境配置 (VS Code/CLion)\n调试技巧\n02.

C 字符串的痛点\n要理解 SDS 的设计，首先得知道 C 语言字符串（C-String）有哪些缺陷：\n获取长度 O(N)：C 字符串不记录长度，必须遍历整个数组找到 \\0 才能计算出长度。这对于高频操作 STRLEN 来说是无法接受的。\n二进制不安全：C 字符串以 \\0 作为结束符，这意味着字符串中间不能包含空字符。这限制了它只能存储文本，无法存储图片、音频、压缩包等二进制数据。\n缓冲区溢出风险：C 字符串拼接（strcat）时，如果程序员忘记分配足够的空间，就会导致缓冲区溢出，覆盖相邻内存的数据，造成程序崩溃或安全漏洞。\n内存管理效率低：每次修改字符串长度（增长或缩短），都需要重新进行内存分配（realloc），开销巨大。\n2. SDS 的结构设计\nRedis 在 sds.h 中定义了 SDS 的头部结构。为了节省内存，Redis 设计了 5 种不同类型的 Header (sdshdr5, sdshdr8, sdshdr16, sdshdr32, sdshdr64)，根据字符串长度选择最小的头部。\n以最常用的 sdshdr8 为例：\n关键设计点：\nO(1) 获取长度：len 字段直接记录了字符串长度，STRLEN 命令瞬间完成。\n二进制安全：SDS 虽然也保留了末尾的 \\0（为了兼容 C 标准库函数如 printf），但它不以 \\0 判断结束，而是严格依赖 len 属性。因此，buf 中间可以安全地包含 \\0。\n紧凑内存布局：__attribute__ ((__packed__)) 告诉编译器取消字节对齐，强制结构体紧凑排列。这不仅节省内存，还让 SDS 指针（指向 buf 的指针）可以通过 sds[-1] 快速访问到 flags，进而确定 Header 类型。\n3. 内存管理策略\nSDS 通过 空间预分配 和 惰性空间释放 两种策略，解决了 C 字符串内存分配频繁的问题。\n3.1 空间预分配 (Space Pre-allocation)\n当 SDS 需要进行扩展（如 sdscat）时，Redis 不仅会分配所需的空间，还会多分配一部分作为缓冲（Free Space）。\n逻辑在 sds.c/sdsMakeRoomFor 函数中：\n如果修改后长度 &lt; 1MB：分配 new_len * 2 的空间。例如，增长后需要 100 字节，实际分配 200 字节。\n如果修改后长度 &gt;= 1MB：分配 new_len + 1MB 的空间。避免分配过大的内存造成浪费。\n这种策略将连续 N 次字符串追加操作的内存重分配次数，从 N 次降低为 最多 N 次（通常远小于 N）。\n3.2 惰性空间释放 (Lazy Freeing)\n当 SDS 缩短（如 sdstrim）时，Redis 不会立即回收 多余的内存，而是更新 len，保持 alloc 不变。\n这就为将来可能的增长操作预留了空间。当然，如果你真的需要释放内存，可以使用 sdsRemoveFreeSpace 函数来真正释放未使用的空间。\n4. 源码精读：sdsMakeRoomFor\n让我们看一眼 sds.c 中最核心的扩容逻辑（简化版）：\n5. 总结\nSDS 是 Redis 源码中最简单但也最精妙的设计之一。它通过简单的结构体封装，完美解决了 C 字符串的诸多痛点，实现了：\n高性能：O(1) 长度获取，减少内存分配。\n安全性：杜绝缓冲区溢出，支持二进制数据。\n兼容性：保留 \\0 结尾，兼容部分 C 字符串函数。\n理解了 SDS，你就迈出了阅读 Redis 源码的坚实第一步。下一篇，我们将挑战 Redis 中最为核心的数据结构 —— Dict (字典)，看看 Redis 是如何实现高效的 Hash 表及渐进式 Rehash 的。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/02-sds/","title":"Redis 源码阅读：02. SDS (Simple Dynamic String)"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/03-dict/":{"body":"如果说 SDS 是 Redis 的肌肉，那么 Dict (字典/哈希表) 就是 Redis 的骨架。\nRedis 本身就是一个巨大的 KV 数据库，这个 “KV” 的底层实现就是 Dict。此外，Redis 的 Hash 类型、Set 类型（当元素多时）、ZSet 的一部分（查找成员 Score）都严重依赖 Dict。\n本文将带你深入 dict.h 和 dict.c，理解 Redis 字典的设计哲学，重点解析它是如何通过 渐进式 Rehash 解决大规模数据扩容时的卡顿问题的。\n1. 核心结构体\nRedis 的字典实现非常经典，采用了 开链法 (Chaining) 来解决哈希冲突。\n1.1 dictEntry (节点)\n这是哈希表中的最小单位，保存了具体的键值对。\n1.2 dictht (哈希表)\n这是一个标准的哈希表结构。\n1.3 dict (字典)\n这是最外层的包装。注意：这里有两个 dictht。\n2. 为什么要两个哈希表？(ht[0] &amp; ht[1])\n大多数语言（如 Java HashMap, C++ std::unordered_map）内部只有一个哈希表。扩容时，它们会创建一个更大的新数组，然后一次性将所有数据迁移过去。\n对于 Redis 这种单线程内存数据库，一次性迁移几百万甚至上亿个 Key 是灾难性的。这会导致服务器在几百毫秒甚至几秒内无法响应任何请求（Stop-The-World）。\n为了解决这个问题，Redis 引入了 渐进式 Rehash (Progressive Rehash)。\n3. 渐进式 Rehash 详解\n渐进式 Rehash 的核心思想是：分而治之。将庞大的迁移工作分摊到后续的每一次增删改查操作中，以及后台的定时任务中。\n3.1 触发条件\n当以下条件满足时，Redis 会开始扩容：\n服务器没有执行 BGSAVE (RDB) 或 BGREWRITEAOF (AOF 重写)，且负载因子 (used / size) &gt;= 1。\n服务器正在执行 BGSAVE 等子进程，但负载因子 &gt;= 5 (强制扩容)。\n此时，dict 的 rehashidx 从 -1 变为 0，标志着 Rehash 开始。ht[1] 被分配空间（大小通常是 ht[0] 的 2 倍）。\n3.2 迁移过程\nRehash 开始后，并没有立即迁移数据。迁移发生在以下两个时间点：\n被动迁移 (Lazy)：\n每次对字典执行添加、删除、查找或更新操作时（dictAdd, dictFind 等），程序除了执行指定操作外，还会顺带将 ht[0] 中 rehashidx 索引位置上的所有键值对迁移到 ht[1]，然后将 rehashidx 加 1。\n主动迁移 (Active)：\nRedis 的 serverCron 定时任务中，会花费 1 毫秒的时间来进行 Rehash（dictRehashMilliseconds），防止长期没有读写导致 Rehash 停滞。\n3.3 Rehash 期间的读写\n在 Rehash 进行期间，字典同时使用 ht[0] 和 ht[1]：\n添加 (Add)：新数据一律添加到 ht[1]。保证 ht[0] 只减不增，最终变为空。\n查找/删除 (Find/Delete)：先在 ht[0] 找，找不到再去 ht[1] 找。\n3.4 结束\n当 ht[0] 中所有节点都被迁移到 ht[1] 后，Rehash 结束：\n释放 ht[0]。\n将 ht[1] 设置为 ht[0]。\n重置 ht[1] 为空。\nrehashidx 设为 -1。\n4. 源码精读：dictRehash\n这是渐进式 Rehash 的核心函数 dict.c/dictRehash：\n5. 总结\nRedis 的 Dict 实现充分体现了工程设计的权衡：\n使用 链地址法 解决冲突，简单且内存利用率高。\n通过 双哈希表 + 渐进式 Rehash，完美解决了单线程模型下的大规模扩容卡顿问题。这是 Redis 能够保持极低延迟的关键技术之一。\n下一篇，我们将研究 Redis 中那些为了省内存而“丧心病狂”设计的数据结构 —— ZipList (压缩列表) 与 ListPack。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/03-dict/","title":"Redis 源码阅读：03. Dict (字典与渐进式 Rehash)"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/04-ziplist-listpack/":{"body":"Redis 是一个内存数据库，内存就是成本。为了在存储小量数据时节省内存，Redis 设计了 ZipList（压缩列表）。但 ZipList 存在设计缺陷，因此 Redis 5.0 引入了 ListPack（紧凑列表）作为替代品，并将在 Redis 7.0+ 中逐步全面接管 ZipList 的职责。\n1. ZipList：极致的压缩，致命的缺陷\nZipList 不是双向链表，而是一块连续的内存块。\n1.1 结构设计\n一个 ZipList 的内存布局如下：\nzlbytes (4字节): 总字节数。\nzltail (4字节): 尾节点偏移量（方便快速定位尾部，实现从尾向头遍历）。\nzllen (2字节): 节点数量。\nzlend (1字节): 结束标记 (0xFF)。\nEntry (节点) 的结构：\nprevlen: 前一个节点的长度。这是实现从后向前遍历的关键。\nencoding: 编码类型（是整数还是字符串，长度是多少）。\nentry-data: 实际数据。\n1.2 连锁更新 (Cascading Update) —— ZipList 的阿喀琉斯之踵\n问题出在 prevlen 字段上。\n如果前一个节点长度 &lt; 254 字节，prevlen 占用 1 字节。\n如果前一个节点长度 &gt;= 254 字节，prevlen 占用 5 字节。\n场景模拟：\n假设有一个 ZipList，包含多个长度为 253 字节的节点（E1, E2, E3…）。此时它们的 prevlen 都是 1 字节。\n现在，我们将 E1 的数据更新为 254 字节。\nE2 的 prevlen 需要记录 E1 的长度，发现 E1 变大了，prevlen 必须从 1 字节扩展到 5 字节。\nE2 整体长度增加了 4 字节，变成了 253 + 4 = 257 字节。\nE3 的 prevlen 需要记录 E2 的长度，发现 E2 也变大了…\n多米诺骨牌效应触发，后面所有的节点都需要重新分配内存并移动数据。\n这就是连锁更新，最坏情况下时间复杂度为 O(N^2)。这也是为什么 Redis 限制 ZipList 只能存少量数据的原因。\n2. ListPack：完美的继任者\nListPack (紧凑列表) 的设计目标就是：保持 ZipList 紧凑内存布局的同时，彻底解决连锁更新问题。\n2.1 结构设计\nListPack 的整体结构与 ZipList 类似，但更简单：\nElement (节点) 的结构变了：\nencoding-type: 编码类型。\nelement-data: 数据。\nelement-tot-len: 当前节点的总长度 (包含 encoding 和 data)。\n2.2 为什么 ListPack 没有连锁更新？\n关键在于：ListPack 的节点不再保存前一个节点的长度，只保存当前节点的长度。\n正向遍历：根据 encoding 解析出数据长度，跳到下一个节点。\n反向遍历：读取当前节点末尾的 element-tot-len，回退相应的字节数，找到前一个节点的末尾。\n因为每个节点的长度只与自己有关，修改一个节点永远不会影响下一个节点的长度字段。彻底根除了连锁更新。\n3. 总结\nZipList: 为了省内存而生，但 prevlen 的变长设计导致了潜在的性能风险。\nListPack: 站在巨人的肩膀上，保留了紧凑布局的优点，通过改变长度记录方式（存自身长度而非前驱长度），完美解决了连锁更新问题。\n在 Redis 7.0 中，ListPack 已经替代 ZipList 用于实现 Hash (当元素少时) 和 ZSet (当元素少时)。ZipList 正在逐渐退出历史舞台。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/redis/04-ziplist-listpack/","title":"Redis 源码阅读：04.

工程师中大部分是标准的软件工程师，他们擅长使用系统工程的方法去解决基础系统中的问题，同时持续的、工程化的解决问题，使得运维的压力不会随着上层应用的增加而线性增加（通常 20 人的 SRE 团队，可以支持上千研发同学的应用开发）**。**同时 SRE 同学对 Unix 系统内部细节、1～3 层网络比较了解，可以同研发一起分析应用程序性能问题。\nSRE

通过稳定性进行抽象，可以通用的解决稳定性问题\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;为了让庞大系统的运行效率提高，要不断的优化系统中的热点，并将系统中的热点服务扩展、升级、重构成为一个组建化的服务，这也是 SRE 中解耦系统的方法。不仅如此，SRE 对各个服务的可用性进行标准化定义，将统一的标准应用到不同的服务中去，将稳定性作为各个服务的重要度量指标，通过上述操作，收拢服务治理问题，提供系统的鲁棒性。\n2.2 明确服务之间的可用性依赖\n2.2.1 面向 SLO 编程标准的推行\n针对 SLO，我们举一个例子来说明以下，\n为什么要有 SLO，设置 SLO

Implementing SLOs for a New Service - https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon19americas/presentation/lawson）\n推荐一篇文章，阐述请求延时的 SLO 如何指定的，具体可以参考链接《Latency SLOs Done Right》https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/srecon19apac_schlossnagle_latency_slides.pdf\n推荐一篇文章，从请求在系统运行中阐述了一些核型的 SLO 该如何制定，《How to trade off server utilization and tail latency》https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/srecon19apac_slides_plenz.pdf\n2.2.2 面向 SLO 监控的设计 — SLO 结果导向的告警，而不是原因导向的告警\n四个黄金信号\n当平台服务不可用，或访问速度变慢时，往往会影响到产品的整体质量，目前了解到的一些基础监控指标就达到上百种，通常的做法是在这些指标当中需要选取平台或业务比较关注的指标进行监控报警；\nGoogle 的网站可靠性工程师小组（SRE）定义了四个需要监控的关键指标。他们称之为 “四个黄金信号”：延迟（Latency），流量（Traffic），错误（Errors）和饱和度（Saturation）。这四个信号应该是服务级别非常关键部分，因为它们对于提供高可用性的服务至关重要。\n如何定义高质量的监控：\n明确业务服务的 SLO（应该与该业务提供给客户的期望达成一致），并采用合理的 SLI 来描述；比如计数信息（总量、成功量）、测量信息（同比、环比）；\n主观上监控应该有丰富的内部状态数据、具备高可观测性条件；客观上具备业务视角，能够快速定位是全局问题还是局部问题；系统本身的鲁棒性，不会因为某个局部问题影响监控的权威性；具备 quota 限制能力，防止出现容量的问题；\n报警清理和定期的规则优化，定期进行盘点告警，并优化掉无 SLO 影响的规则；\n2.3 完善的场景化演练\n自动化系统的建设中除了要考虑系统的能力外，还要考虑人在其中所发挥的重要作用，毕竟一旦一些突发的时事件若必须由人来处理，则这时刻人的稳定性和准确性也是需要保证的。微软在 SRE 大会中提出了一个有意思的观点：如果一个系统能够比人做的更好，那人应该知道如何监控这个系统本身。因此，在保证 SLO 的情况下，可以做一些攻防演练（关闭 SRE 系统的 UI 后，SRE 该如何操作？）；或构建一个模拟系统，让人来执行系统；并学习故障的复盘报告等。\n三、浅谈 SRE 的观察\n3.1 从 SRE2019 观察\nSRE CONF 2019 传送门：\nConference Report：SRECON AMERICAS 2019 ： https://noidea.dog/blog/srecon-americas-2019\nConference

agreement，即服务级别协议）也称服务等级协议，经常被用来衡量服务稳定性指标。通常被称作“几个9”，9越多代表服务全年可用时间越长服务也就越可靠，即停机时间越短。通常作为服务提供商与受服务用户之间具体达成承诺的服务指标——质量、可用性，责任。\n3个9，即99.9%，全年可停服务时间：365 * 24 * 60 *（1-99.9%）= 525.6min\n4个9，即99.99%，全年可停服务时间：365 * 24 * 60 *（1-99.99%）= 52.56min\n5个9，即99.999%，全年可停服务时间：365 * 24 * 60 *（1-99.999%）= 5.256min\n在严苛的服务级别协议背后，其实是一些列规范要求来进行保障。\n2021 年全球重大的系统事故，其中不乏亚马逊、特斯拉、Facebook

月约4小时美联储大部分业务操作失误\n—&nbsp;2&nbsp;—\n何为系统稳定性\n我们先看下百度百科对稳定性定义：\n系统稳定性是指系统要素在外界影响下表现出的某种稳定状态。\n其次维基百科对稳定性定义：\n稳定性是数学或工程上的用语，判别一系统在有界的输入是否也产生有界的输出。\n若是，称系统为稳定；若否，则称系统为不稳定。\n简单理解，系统稳定性本质上是系统的确定性应答。\n从另一个角度解释，服务稳定性建设就是如何保障系统能够满足SLA所要求的服务等级协议。\nGoogle SRE中（SRE三部曲）有一个层级模型来描述系统可靠性基础和高层次需求（Dickerson’s Hierarchy of Service Reliability），如下图：\n该模型由Google SRE工程师Mikey Dickerson在2013年提出，将系统稳定性需求按照基础程度进行了不同层次的体系化区分，形成稳定性标准金字塔模型。\n金字塔的底座是监控（Monitoring），这是一个系统对于稳定性最基础的要求，缺少监控的系统，如同蒙上眼睛狂奔的野马，无从谈及可控性，更遑论稳定性。\n更上层是应急响应（Incident Response），从一个问题被监控发现到最终解决，这期间的耗时直接取决于应急响应机制的成熟度。合理的应急策略能保证当故障发生时，所有问题能得到有序且妥善的处理，而不是慌乱成一锅粥。\n事后总结以及根因分析（Postmortem&amp;Root Caue Analysis），即我们平时谈到的“复盘”，虽然很多人都不太喜欢这项活动，但是不得不承认这是避免我们下次犯同样错误的最有效手段。只有当摸清故障的根因以及对应的缺陷，我们才能对症下药，合理进行规避。\n假设一个系统从初次发布后就不再进行更新迭代，做好上述三个方面的工作就能基本满足系统对于稳定性的全部需求。可惜目前基本不会存在这样的系统，大大小小的应用都离不开不断的变更与发布，因此要保证系统在这些迭代中持续稳定，测试和发布管控（Testing&amp;Release procedures）是必不可少的。有效的测试与发布策略能保障系统所有新增变量都处于可控稳定区间内，从而达到整体服务终态稳定。\n除了代码逻辑更新，迭代同样可能带来业务规模及流量的变化，容量规划（Capacity Planning）则是针对于这方面变化进行的保障策略。现有系统体量是否足够支撑新的流量需求，整体链路上是否存在不对等的薄弱节点，都是容量规划需要考虑的问题。\n位于金字塔模型最顶端的是产品设计（Product）与软件研发（Development），即通过优秀的产品设计与软件设计使系统具备更高的可靠性，构建高可用产品架构体系，从而提升用户体验。\n为了方便，本文阐述的系统主要指软件系统。那么如何衡量系统稳定性的高与低呢？一个常用的指标就是服务可用时长占比，占比越高说明系统稳定性也越高。如果我们拿一整年的数据来看，常见的 4 个 9（99.99%）意味着我们系统提供的服务全年的不可用时长只有 52 分钟！\n它其实是一个综合指标，为什么这么说？因为我们在服务可用的定义上会有一些差别，常见的服务可用包括：服务无异常、服务响应时间低、服务有效（逻辑正确）、服务能正常触发等。\n—&nbsp;3&nbsp;—\n稳定性建设目标\n架构设计源于生活，稳定性建设也肯定是源于生活，一般会把稳定性和消防放在一起进行比喻方便大家的理解，处理火灾主要是阶段：在火灾前预防火灾，在第一时间知道发生火灾了，在发生火情的时候如何快速救火。通过火灾处理对比软件系统的稳定性，也就是预防（事前）、发现和处理（事中）了，最后（事后）我们加入了复盘。发生问题不可怕，可怕的是已发生的问题重复发生。一定要杜绝有问题的事情第二次发生。\n防火的最高境界是，防患于未然。这也就催生了，现代软件系统里面，大家把更多的精力放在事前（全链路压测和故障演练方面）。\n—&nbsp;4&nbsp;—\n稳定性治理\n影响稳定性的主要在两个阶段，一个阶段是非运行期，一个阶段是运行期。非运行期主要就是我们日常进行开发的时候，技术方案设计，代码书写，线上操作配置等引发的稳定性问题。运行期主要是因服务自身问题、外部调用问题，外部依赖问题引发的稳定性，所以治理也主要从这两个方面出发。\n接下来会以上线前、上线中、上线后三个阶段进行总结稳定性治理。\n上线前\n很多时候我们都以为系统稳定只是线上运行稳定就好了，但事实上需求研发流程是否规范，也会极大地影响到系统的稳定性。试想一下，如果谁都可以随便提需求、做的功能没有做方案设计、谁都可以直接操作线上服务器，那么这样的系统服务能够稳定得了吗？所以说，需求上线前的过程也是影响系统稳定性的重大因素。\n在我看来，在上线前这个阶段，主要有三大块非常重要的稳定性建设内容，分别是：\n研发流程规范\n发布流程规范\n高可用架构设计\n1、研发流程规范\n研发流程规范，指的是一个需求从提出到完成的整个过程应该是怎样流转的。一般的需求研发流程包括：产品提出需求、技术预研、需求评审、技术方案设计、测试用例评审、技术方案评审、测试用例评审、需求开发、代码评审、需求测试。不同公司根据情况会有所调整，但大差不差。\n在这个流程中，与研发相关的几个比较重要的节点是：技术方案设计及评审、测试用例评审及评审、需求开发、代码测试覆盖率、代码评审。我们上面提到的几个影响稳定性的因素，就是因为没有做好这几个节点的工作导致的，包括：\n未测试需求直接上线\n上线的需求产品不知道\n上线的新需求有bug\n上线后没有线上验证\n系统设计方案存在缺陷\n系统代码实现存在缺陷\n如果能够处理好上述几个节点，那么就能够极大地降低研发流程导致的问题。这里每个节点都有很深的学问，这里就不展开讲了，我们主要说个思路。\n**研发团队最希望拿到的需求是真正有业务价值的需求，而不是一个短期或临时的需求。**因为如果是一个临时需求的话，往往对应的解决方案也是临时的，如果太多临时的解决方案遗留在系统中，久而久之将会变成巨大的“技术债”，总有一天会爆发，对系统稳定性及业务迭代速度造成巨大影响。\n另外有一点比较重要的是，通过需求评审，不仅仅是评审产品业务需求，更重要的是需要研发挖掘出一些非功能需求，包括性能指标要求、依赖三方接口QPS、安全等要求。\n对于编码规范、技术方案评审、代码评审、发布计划评审，这里重点讲一下这四点。\n1）编码规范\n对外接口命名方式、统一异常父类、业务异常码规范、对外提供服务不可用是抛异常还是返回错误码、统一第三方库的版本、哪些场景必须使用内部公共库、埋点日志怎么打、提供统一的日志、监控切面实现等，编码规范除了能规范开发的编码行为、避免犯一些低级错误和踩一些重复的坑外，另一个好处是让新入职的同学能快速了解公司的编码原则，这点对编码快速上手很重要，更多可以参考阿里巴巴的Java开发规范。\n2）技术方案评审\n再也没有比糟糕的设计更有破坏力的东西了，技术方案设计评审和CR可以放在一起做，先评审设计再进行CR，有人就会说，都编码完了才进行设计评审是不是晚了？其实这要看情况而定，如果团队内部经常产出“糟糕设计”，那么我觉得设计评审就应该编码之前来做，但如果团队成员专业能力和经验都还不错，那么我们允许你再编码之后再做设计评审，而且编码的过程其实也是设计的过程，可以规避提前设计而导致后续编码和设计不一致的问题。设计评审的原则是，既要讲最终的设计方案，也要讲你淘汰的设计方案！\n关于如何写技术方案以及评审更多细节，可以参考我之前公众号写的文章：《如何写好&amp;评审一份技术方案》\n3）代码评审\n代码质量包括功能性代码质量和非功能性代码质量，功能质量大多通过测试能够去发现问题，非功能性代码质量用户不能直接体验到这种质量的好坏，代码质量不好，最直接的“受害者”是开发者或组织自身，因为代码质量好坏直接决定了软件的可维护性成本的高低。\n代码质量应该更多的应该从可测性，可读性，可理解性，容变性等代码可维护性维度去衡量，其中CodeReview是保证代码质量非常重要的一个环节，建立良好的CodeReview规范与习惯，对于一个技术团队是一件非常重要核心的事情，没有CodeReview的团队没有未来。\n每次项目开发自测完成后，通常会组织该小组开发人员集体进行代码review，代码review一般review代码质量以及规范方面的问题，另外需要关注的是每一行代码变更是否与本次需求相关，如果存在搭车发布或者代码重构优化，需要自行保证测试通过，否则不予发布。\n关于如何做好代码评审细节，更多可以参考我之前写的公众号文章《如何做好CodeReview》。\n4）发布计划评审\n涉及到10人日以上的项目，必须有明确的发布计划，并组织项目成员统一参加项目发布计划review。发布计划主要包含如下几点：\n明确是否有外部依赖接口，如有请同步协调好业务方；\n发布前配置确认包括配置文件、数据库配置、中间件配置等各种配置，尤其各种环境下的差异化配置项；\n二方库发布顺序，是否有依赖；\n应用发布顺序；\n数据库是否有数据变更和订正，以及表结构调整；\n回滚计划，必须要有回滚计划，发布出现问题要有紧急回滚策略；\n生产环境回归测试重点 Case。\n2、发布流程规范\n发布流程规范主要是为了控制发布权限以及发布频率的问题。\n在项目初始，为了快速响应业务，一般权限控制都很松，很多人都可以进行线上服务的发布。但随着业务越来越多、流量越来越大，相对应的故障也越来越多，到了某个时候就需要对权限做管控，并且需要对需求的发布频率做控制。\n对于需求发布流程来说，一般有几种发布方式，分别是：Release Train方式、零散发布方式。Release Train意思是固定时间窗口发布，例如每周四发布一次。如果无法赶上这次发布时间，那么就需要等到下次发布窗口。零散发布方式，指的是有需要就发布，不做发布时间控制。但这种方式一般只在项目初期发挥作用，后期一般都会收紧。\n除此之外，发布流程中都会设有紧急发布流程，即如果某个需求特别重要，或者有紧急漏洞需要修复，那么可以通过该流程来紧急修复，从而避免因未到时间窗口而对业务产生影响。但一般来说，紧急发布流程都比较麻烦，除非迫不得已不然不要审批通过，不然Release Train方式可能会退化成零散发布方式。\n3、高可用架构设计\n高可用架构设计指的是为了让系统在各种异常情况下都能正常工作，从而使得系统更加稳定。其实这块应该是属于研发流程规范中的技术方案设计的，但研发流程规范更加注重于规范，高可用设计更加注重高可用。另外，也由于高可用设计是非常重要，因此独立拿出来作为一块来说说。\n对于高可用设计来说，一般可分为两大块，分别是：服务治理和容灾设计。\n服务治理就包括了限流、降级、熔断、隔离等，这一些考虑点都是为了让系统在某些特殊情况下，都能稳定工作。例如限流是为了在上游请求量太大的时候，系统不至于被巨大的流量击垮，还可以正常提供服务。服务治理这块像SpringCloud Alibaba都有标准的成熟解决方案，比如可以基于sentinel实现限流、降级、熔断、隔离，隔离可以实现线程池隔离和信号量隔离，这里不再做详细介绍。\n容灾设计应该说是更加高端点的设计了，指的是当下游系、第三方、中间件挂了，如何保证系统还能正常运行。可以说容灾设计比起服务治理，其面临的情况更加糟糕。例如支付系统最终是通过A服务商进行支付的，如果A服务商突然挂了，那我们的支付系统是不是就挂了？那有什么办法可以在这种情况（灾难）发生的时候，让我们的系统还能够正常提供服务呢？这就是容灾设计需要做的事情了，接下来将重点介绍一些容灾设计方案。\n1）消除单点\n从请求发起侧到服务处理返回的调用全链路的各个环节上避免存在单点（某个环节只由单个服务器完成功能），做到每个环节使用相互独立的多台服务器进行分布式处理，要针对不同稳定性要求级别和成本能力做到不同服务器规模分布式，这样就避免单个服务器挂掉引发单点故障后进而导致服务整体挂掉的风险。\n可能涉及的环节有端动态获取资源服务（HTML&amp;JS&amp;小程序包等）、域名解析、多服务商多区域多机房IP入口、静态资源服务、接入路由层、服务逻辑层、任务调度执行层、依赖的微服务、数据库及消息中间件。\n冗余依赖，消除单点的策略：\n在服务逻辑层采用多运营商多IP入口、跨地&amp;同地多机房部署、同机房多机器部署、分布式任务调度等策略。\n在数据存储层采用数据库分库分表、数据库主从备集群、KV存储&amp;消息等分布式系统集群多副本等策略。\n有分布式处理能力后，需要考虑单个服务器故障后自动探活摘除、服务器增删能不停服自动同步给依赖方等问题，这里就需引入一些分布式中枢控制系统，如服务注册发现系统、配置变更系统等，例如zookeeper是一个经典应用于该场景的一个分布式组件。\n2）冗余设计\n冗余设计，对于飞机而言，体现在机组包括机长副机长，引擎至少双发，操作系统至少两套等等，于我们的系统而言，则通常体现在:\n数据冗余，数据多份副本，DB 一主多备，出现问题时可以快速切换。\n计算能力冗余，服务器的计算能力始终保持一定冗余，在一组服务器出现问题时其他服务器可以接替提供服务,亦或在业务量波动时可以承受冲击。\n网络，存储或其他基础设施冗余，出现意外时，比如断电，光纤断裂时均有备用可以实现切换，快速恢复。\n冗余设计这块直接延伸出来的异地多活方案，更多详细的设计可以参考我之前写的公众号文章：《高可用容灾架构演进之路》\n3）强弱依赖\n当服务依赖各类微服务时，避免强依赖（依赖服务挂掉会到自己服务挂掉），尽可能在对应服务出现问题时做到自动降级处理（弱依赖）或者手工降级，降级后依赖服务功能局部去掉或做合适局部提示，局部体验上有部分降级，但不会让主链路和整体功能挂掉。\n对于稳定性要求很好的关键系统，在成本可接受的情况下，同时维护一套保障主链路可用的备用系统和架构，在核心依赖服务出现问题能做一定时间周期的切换过渡（例如MySQL故障，阶段性使用KV数据库等）。\n强依赖的服务越少，系统整体基础稳定性就越高。部分特殊数据依赖多于逻辑依赖的系统，做去依赖架构设计也是一个思路，将依赖服务数据统一整合到自有服务的数据存储中，通过消息 或定时更新的方式更新，做到不依赖 或少依赖其他系统，进而提高稳定性，但这样做也会有副作用：数据冗余可能会引发不同程度一定时间窗口数据不一致性。\n4）热点极限值处理\n业务规模以及数据规模大的部分系统，在系统中会出现数据热点、数据极度倾斜、少量大客户超过极限阈值使用等极限场景，例如超级大客户广告投放物料、广告点击展示数据、API调用频次都是比普通客户大很多，如果按照客户维度分库分表，基本在物料更新、查询、报表查看等一系列的场景都可能导致单库抖动，这除了影响大客户自己外也会影响分布在该分库分表上所有普通客户。\n电商中极度畅销商品以及秒杀、微博等订阅类明星大V的信息发布等都是少量极限场景可能会引发整体系统稳定性问题。因此，架构设计时，要分析自己系统中是否存在极限场景并设计对应方案做好应对。\n极限场景中不同类型场景处理架构方案也不一样，可能的方式：\n大客户从普通客户分库分表中拆出来隔离建库表，隔离享用专有资源以及独立库表拆分路由逻辑以及隔离服务逻辑计算资源；\n大客户特定极限数据计算做预约计算以及预加载，在低峰期预约或提前优化完成；\n秒杀系统极限值可以考虑核心逻辑简化+消息解耦、同商品库存拆分独立交易、部分查询或处理KV存储替代关系型存储、数据提前预热加载、排队、限流策略等策略；\n在特定极限值系统架构以及资源无法满足的情况，产品侧以及技术侧要明确采用最高阈值调用限制。\n5）资损风险\n交易系统对于数据准确性、一致性、资金损失等都是很敏感的，这一块在是否使用缓存、事务一致性考量、数据时延、数据不丢不重、数据精准核对和恢复等需要额外架构设计考量。\n仔细评估交易以及营销的全链路各个环节，评估其中出现资损的可能性以及做好应对设计，例如增加多层级对账、券总额度控制、异常金额限制和报警等资损防控的考量等。\n不同层次不同维度不同时间延迟的对账以及预案是一个重要及时感知资损和止血的有效方式。全链路的过程数据要做好尽可能持久化和冗余备份，方便后续核对以及基于过程数据进行数据修复，同时尽量针对特殊数据丢失场景提供快速自动化修复处理预案（如交易消息可选择性回放和基于幂等原则的重新消费）。\n6）弹性处理\n消息重复消费、接口重复调用对应的服务是否保证幂等？是否考虑了服务降级？哪些业务支持降级？支持自动降级还是手工降级？是否考虑了服务的超时熔断、异常熔断、限流熔断？触发熔断后对客户的影响？服务是否做了隔离，单一服务故障是否影响全局？这些问题统统需要我们想清楚对应的解决方案，才会进一步保证架构设计的合理性。\n7）兼容性\n上下游依赖是否梳理过，影响范围多大？怎么进行新老系统替换？新老系统能否来回切换？数据存储是否兼容老的数据处理？如果对你的上下游系统有影响，是否通知到上下游业务方？上下游依赖方进行升级的方案成本如何最小化？这些问题需要有完美的解决方案，稍有不慎会导致故障。\n8）安全性\n是否彻底避免 SQL 注入和 XSS？是否有数据泄露的可能性？是否做了风控策略？接口服务是否有防刷保护机制？数据、功能权限是否做了控制？小二后台系统是否做了日志审计？数据传输是否加密验签？应用代码中是否有明文的 AK/SK、密码？这些安全细节问题需要我们统统考虑清楚，安全问题任何时候都不能轻视。\n9）其他异常情况\n整体系统架构高可用还需要考虑可测性、可运维性，除了正向逻辑、性能、扩展性设计等外，要增加一个异常设计视角，穷尽思考各类异常情况以及设计应对策略。\n4、容量评估\n系统设计整体至少考虑应对5到10倍或近1到3年系统规模增长，要保障后续通过增加机器资源等快速方式能实现系统水平扩容。例如分库分表的规模提前设计好提前量，避免临时数据库能力不足导致需要临时重构扩容（增加分库分表以及修改路由以及迁移数据）；服务逻辑层设计持有数据状态导致无法加机器做服务层扩容。\n互联网产品发展变化较快，不一定会如期爆发，容量架构设计上也要注意不要过度提前设计，避免提前复杂化引发研发效率以及机器成本问题。\n针对线上流量峰值，建议系统常态保持近期峰值3倍左右容量余量，上线前和上线后要定期做压测摸高，写流量可用影子表等方式做压测，压测可单接口以及模拟线上流量分布压测结合，根据压测结果优化架构或扩容，持续保持容量富余。\n对于可能超过系统现有容量的突发峰值，限流策略是线上要配置的策略。入口侧入口流量调用 、不同渠道服务依赖调用、对依赖服务的调用都要评估可极限调研的上限值，通过中间件等合适方式限制超过阈值调用，避免引发雪崩效应。特定业务系统，对于超过峰值流量，可以通过消息架构以及合适体验设计做削峰填谷。针对恶意攻击流量也要考虑在入口层部署防DDOS攻击的流量清洗层。\n部分系统峰值变化较大且需要持续尽可能承载保障，可考虑引入弹性伸缩策略，预约或根据流量变化触发系统自动扩缩容，以确保以尽量小成本来自动化满足变化峰值。\n上线中\n上线时这个阶段，主要是确保功能按照原先设计的方案进行部署，这个阶段主要是确保规范操作，避免失误，因此可以制定相关的CheckList以及变更审批。其次，为了避免还可能存在未发现的功能缺陷，有时候还可以使用灰度发布降低风险。在这个阶段能做的一些稳定性建设如下图所示。\n对于发布前的checklist更多可以参考前面所讲的发布计划，发布后的checklist更多的需要根据测试提供的测试用例进行生产环境回归测试验证。\n这里涉及到的变更审批非常关键，根据实际情况，有些审批可以提前提交申请。\n灰度保障及时在小流量情况，发现问题，避免引发大范围故障。因此在做系统任何变更时，要考虑灰度方案，特别是大用户流量系统。灰度方式可能有白名单用户、按用户Id固定划分后不同流量比例、机器分批发布、业务概念相关分组分比例（例如某个行业、某个商品、某类商品）等，灰度周期要和结合系统风险和流量做合适设计，重要系统灰度周期可能持续超过一周或更多。\n关于灰度发布更多细节，可以参考我之前公众号写的文章《灰度发布架构设计终极篇》。\n上线后\n当系统成功上线后，很多小伙伴以为工作就结束了，但实际上我们还有不少工作可以做。根据我的经验，在上线后我们能做的稳定性建设包括：\n监控报警\n故障管理\n紧急预案\n故障容灾演练\n案例学习\n全链路压测\n全链路跟踪\n1、监控告警\n监控报警，指的是我们需要对应用做好运行数据的收集，监控好系统的运行状态。当系统状态异常时，我们需要及时地发现并报警，从而让研发人员快速地解决问题。一般来说，监控报警分为系统级别的监控报警和业务级别的监控报警。系统级别的监控报警包括 CPU、内存、磁盘等服务器资源的监控，而业务级别的报警则需要根据业务情况自行定义。\n2、故障容灾演练\n故障容灾演练需要从已知、半已知和未知三个维度去做。\n已知：已知故障类型，按照应急预案SOP，一步一步去做，从生疏到熟练，从20分钟到5分钟，从有限的人能做变成所有人能做。\n半已知：在已知故障类型的演练中，发现了未知因素，如：当缓存集群故障的时候，切换到备用缓存集群，但发现备用缓存集群里面的缓存数据有问题，需要重新清空及重新进行缓存预热。\n未知：未知故障类型，临时决策安排人员有序散开排查，临时根据现象定位问题，采用回滚版本或者重启等方式尝试性解决问题，或定位到问题后，采用有损的方式试图临时解决问题等。\n故障容灾演练是提升系统稳定性的一把利器，很多时候即使我们设计得很完美，但实际上却没发挥作用，究其根本就是没有实践过。是驴是马，得拉出来溜溜才知道。\n3、故障管理\n故障管理，就是当发生故障时，我们需要遵循的整套处理规范。团队小的时候可能无所谓，但是当团队大了的时候，我们就需要统一大家的故障处理流程，从而可以更快速地解决故障。此外，在故障解决完成之后还需要进行复盘，产出对应的故障报告。\n4、Case Study\nCase Study机制指的是定期学习其他团队的高可用或者线上故障进行学习，从而提高团队的系统设计能力，避免踩坑。\n5、紧急预案\n紧急处理预案，简单就是要想到各种可能发现的情况，然后做好预案。之后结合容灾演练不断进行优化，从而形成一套很好的处理预案。这样当线上发生类似故障时，就可以轻松应对了。\n在发生故障的时候，大多数人的脑子都是一片空白，很难迅速做出最合理的反应。衡量一个应急预案的好坏，关键是看它是否足够“无脑化”。\n举个例子：如果发现了故障A，那么我们需要排查B和C两个方面来精准定位问题，定位后，我们再通过D—&gt;E—&gt;F三个操作来解决问题。\n即：整个过程中，只需要照做，不需要思考，因为思考就会产生选择，而选择取舍是最耗费时间的事情，如果做不到这点，那么证明应急预案还有优化的空间。\n另外，预案也不是一蹴而就的事情，需要跟随架构和业务的演进，不断进行更新迭代，同时，也需要不断做减法，该摒弃的摒弃，该合并的合并，如果只增不减，那么一年以后，预案就会变成一本书。\n紧急预案一般要包含如下内容：\n故障发生时应该通知哪些人或团队。\n如何选出协调者，什么情况下该选出协调者。\n协调者的职责有哪些。\n需要操作开关时，谁有权利决策。\n常见故障以及对应的止损方式。\n止损的原则是什么，什么是最重要的。善后方案谁来拍板。\n预案很重要，完备的预案能降低故障定位和止损的时间，提升协作效率。\n6、自动防御\n这是件很能体现出工程师能力和素养的事情，需要工程师在coding过程中，在任何关键环节都具备安全意识。如：\n当下游依赖的存储集群，由于不可用而触发代码中的失败次数或失败时间阈值时，自动切换到备用的存储集群。\n当下游依赖的核心服务，由于不可用而触发代码中的失败次数或失败时间阈值时，自动降级到备用方案，如：将请求切换到存储非实时数据的ES中，接受有损。\n当系统由于响应时间激增而导致服务不可用时，自动对下游依赖的非核心服务进行降级熔断，减少服务接口的整体响应时间，保证可用。\n7、全链路压测\n全链路压测，指的是对整个链路进行压测。不同公司可能会采用不同的方案，有些会直接在线上进行压测，然后用流量标记的方式识别测试流量。有些则是进行流量录制，之后重新搭建一套与线上非常类似的系统进行压测。一般来说，第一种效果肯定会更好，成本也更低，但是对研发人员要求也更高，风险也更大。比如阿里天猫每年双11都会进行全链路压测，基于线上流量回放机制。\n8、全链路跟踪\n全链路跟踪是生产环境问题排查利器，开源的有Skywalking，阿里内部对应的是EagleEye，能够根据请求traceid，快速诊断出生产环境bug。\n—&nbsp;5&nbsp;—\n技术团队文化\n人的意识是最重要的，专业能力可以锻炼培养。如果意识不足或松懈，好的能力以及机制流程也会形同虚设。\n永远要敬畏线上，敬畏客户体验。面向线上的稳定性战术上可以基于专业度锻炼后自信，但战略和思想上必须持续如履薄冰、三省吾身。线上稳定性保障是作为技术人自己专业度的追求和必须保持初心，始终保持敬畏。不因为业务繁忙、个人心情状态、团队是否重视而有变化，只要职责在，就要守护好。技术主管以及系统owner要有持续感知稳定性隐患和风险，保持锐度，集中性以及系统性查差补漏。\n团队工作规范\n1、日常巡检\n为什么要把系统健康度巡检放到技术管理里，我觉得这是一个非常重要的环节。像传统的航空、电力、汽车行业都要有一定的巡检机制，保障设备系统正常运转，软件系统也同样需要巡检机制保障业务健康发展。\n随着业务的不断发展，业务量和数据量不断的上涨，系统架构的腐蚀是避免不了的，为了保障系统的健康度，需要不断的考虑对系统架构、性能进行优化。\n系统的监控与报警能够一定程度发现系统存在的问题，系统存在的一些隐患需要通过对系统的巡检去发现，如果优化不及时在极端情况会导致故障，巡检粒度建议每周巡检一次自己所负责的业务系统。\n系统巡检重点要关注如下几点：\n系统指标：系统 CPU、负载、内存、网络、磁盘有无异常情况波动，确认是否由发布导致，还是系统调用异常。\n慢接口：通常 RT 大于3s的接口需要重点关注，极端并发场景下容易导致整个系统雪崩。\n慢查询：MySQL 慢查询需要重点关注，随着数据量上涨，需要对慢查询进行优化。\n错误日志：通过错误日志去发现系统隐藏的一些 BUG，避免这些 BUG 被放大，甚至极端情况下会导致故障。\n2、每个报警不要放过，每个报警及时响应处理\n快速定位和快速恢复是个人以及团队专业能力沉淀，但快速报警响应是每个敬畏线上敬畏用户体验的技术同学可以做到的。\n在监控完备和持续前提下，每个报警及时处理即可以降低故障影响范围，也会持续减少小的隐患。报警一些小的实践技巧：报警按照方向收敛报警群，建立报警天级值班机制，报警短信手机设置为震动模式（不打扰同空间家人或朋友情况下，自己第一时间感知），主管要订阅报警作为团队报警兜底处理人，报警响应好的同学和不好的同学要数据化表扬和批评。\n从团队角度，报警及时响应必须配合报警治理进行，否则过多无效报警也会让有责任心的同学变得麻木。所以必须控制无效报警的数量，例如单应用无效报警（不需要线上问题进行定位以及修复处理的）不要超过5条，个人维度无效报警天级别不超过10条。\n3、线上问题要复盘，不论是否为定级故障，不论问题大小\n小的线上问题也要复盘，复盘准备度可以低于定级故障，但都需要思考反思以及落实优化Action。小的线上问题就是未来线上故障的前兆。我们团队周会上都会有一个环节，上周如有线上问题则会安排对触发人做复盘。\n4、每个用户反馈要重视，定位到根本原因\n一个用户反馈背后必然有多个实际线上问题，只是这个用户无法忍受，知道反馈路径以及对这个产品有热爱或强依赖才选择反馈的。彻底定位一个voc，就是修复了一类线上问题。而且到用户反馈的程度，这个线上问题就已经有一定程度用户体验影响了。我们现在技术团队有一个voc日清机制，针对线上voc问题对用户做好日内响应答复，也是一个不错对于这个意识的数字化衡量。\n人员能力培养\n单个技术同学个人技术以及稳定性保障能力是团队在每个稳定性任务上拿到结果的执行者和基础，因此技术主管重视识别不同同学个人优势和不足，针对性做工作安排以及培养锻炼。只要线上意识上足够重视，能力对于大部门技术同学是可以培养的。\n团队内同学由于入行时间、历史经验等各方面原因，对于当前系统稳定性保障能力是有强弱的差异的，对于个人是正常情况，但对于团队而言，不能因为团队个别同学能力上存在不足而引入团队层面稳定性保障风险。\n需要主管很好熟悉以及判断同学能力段位，在负责系统和模块、流程机制约束、辅导人等方面做好差异化安排。例如校招同学X个月不做线上发布，前X个月发布有师兄协同发布机制，并发高或资金交易等等风险高的系统让更加有经验的负责。同时设计培养机制，能力当前不足但有潜力的同学，可以安排由经验丰富的同学指导以及提供一些进阶实操路径，按照节奏从易到难逐渐承担更高风险的系统职责。\n能力培养方式有技术Review、代码CR和辅导、参与团队稳定性保障机制、安排合适师兄指导、过程中主管指导、逐渐承担更高职责等。代码层面，对于Java同学来说，《阿里巴巴Java开发手册》是一个很好的实践性指南，超出代码风格，提供了日志、异常处理、集合等库使用、数据库设计、分层设计等多个提升代码质量的实践做法，我们自己团队所有Java研发同学都会100%通过阿里云上阿里巴巴代码认证考试，同时团队有一个团队内新人品码机制，这些都是不错地培养同学写出好代码的培养方式。\n好多小团队、大团队、公司都有很多不错提升稳定性机制和案例，积极主动参考学习以及结合自己业务系统思考践行，是自己提升重要路径。架构上高可用以及架构相关经典书籍自我学习，从理论上做系统性认知也是有必要。\n—&nbsp;6&nbsp;—\n总结\n在软件架构上有一句名言，没有最完美的架构，只有最适合的架构。推广到稳定性上，没有完全完美的稳定性方案，只有适合的稳定性方案。\n系统稳定性压倒一切，只有保障了好了稳定性，才能帮助业务蓬勃增长，因此稳定性治理始终是工程师基本能力之一。\n稳定性建设是一个系统的基石，也是一个持续的过程，面对业务的不同发展阶段，对稳定性的落地要求不同，取舍也不同（适合的才是最好的~），但随着业务发展，占比越来越大，关注点也会越来越高。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/sre/sre-2/","title":"系统稳定性治理最佳实践"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/sre/system-stability-qa/":{"body":"稳定性的重要性\n用户体验\n小红书\n7月26日晚微博社区开始陆续反馈小红书启动崩溃，并冲上微博热搜。\n7月27日凌晨

核心概念就是让我们的业务系统长时间运行在预期状态，这里的稳定性预期状态包括系统的功能、性能、用户体验等方面，我们通常可以用“正常对外服务时间”来评价稳定性的好坏。具有良好稳定性的系统能够在各种各样的压力和负载时，仍然保持高效、可用。\n可用性一般使用 （1 - 故障时长/总运行时长）来度量，一般在 99.9% ~

Kafka, Purgatory 与分层时间轮\nApache Kafka 有一个称为“请求炼狱 (request purgatory)”的数据结构。该炼狱持有任何尚未满足成功标准但尚未导致错误的请求。问题在于：“我们如何高效地跟踪集群中由其他活动异步满足的数万个请求？”\nKafka 实现了几种无法立即回复响应的请求类型。例如：\n带有 acks=all 的生产请求 (produce request) 在所有同步副本确认写入之前不能被视为完成，以保证如果 Leader 失败数据不会丢失。\n带有 min.bytes=1 的拉取请求 (fetch request) 在至少有一个新字节的数据供消费者消费之前不会被回复。这允许“长轮询”，使得消费者无需忙等待检查新数据的到达。\n当满足以下任一条件时，这些请求被视为完成：(a) 它们请求的标准已完成，或 (b) 发生超时。\n任何时候处于飞行状态 (in-flight) 的这些异步操作的数量随着连接数的增加而扩展，对于 Kafka 来说，这通常是数万个。\n请求炼狱专为处理如此大规模的请求而设计，但旧的实现存在一些缺陷。\n在这篇博客中，我想解释旧实现的问题以及新实现如何解决它。我还将展示基准测试结果。\n旧的 Purgatory 设计\n请求炼狱由一个超时计时器和一个用于事件驱动处理的观察者列表 (watcher lists) 的哈希映射 (hash map) 组成。当请求因条件未满足而无法立即满足时，它会被放入炼狱中。炼狱中的请求稍后在条件满足时完成，或者在超过请求的超时参数指定的时间时强制完成（超时）。在旧设计中，它使用 Java DelayQueue 来实现计时器。\n当请求完成时，该请求不会立即从计时器或观察者列表中删除。相反，已完成的请求是在条件检查期间被发现时才删除的。当删除速度跟不上时，服务器可能会耗尽 JVM 堆内存并导致 OutOfMemoryError。\n为了缓解这种情况，一个单独的线程（称为收割者线程/reaper thread）在炼狱中的请求数量（待处理或已完成）超过配置的数量时，会从炼狱中清除已完成的请求。清除操作会扫描计时器队列和所有观察者列表以查找已完成的请求并将其删除。\n通过将此配置参数设置得很低，服务器实际上可以避免内存问题。但是，如果服务器过于频繁地扫描所有列表，则必须付出巨大的性能代价。\n新的 Purgatory 设计\n新设计的目标是允许立即删除已完成的请求，并显著减少昂贵的清除过程的负载。它需要交叉引用计时器和请求中的条目。此外，强烈希望具有 O(1) 的插入/删除成本，因为每个请求/完成都会发生插入/删除操作。\n为了满足这些要求，我们基于 分层时间轮 (Hierarchical Timing Wheels) 设计了一个新的炼狱实现。\n分层时间轮 (Hierarchical Timing Wheel)\n一个简单的时间轮是一个计时器任务桶 (bucket) 的循环列表。令 u 为时间单位。大小为 n 的时间轮有 n 个桶，可以容纳 n * u 时间间隔内的计时器任务。每个桶保存落入相应时间范围的计时器任务。开始时，第一个桶保存 [0, u) 的任务，第二个桶保存 [u, 2u) 的任务，……，第 n 个桶保存 [u * (n -1), u * n) 的任务。每隔时间单位 u，计时器滴答 (tick) 一次并移动到下一个桶，然后让其中的所有计时器任务过期。因此，计时器永远不会将任务插入当前时间的桶中，因为它已经过期了。计时器立即运行过期的任务。清空的桶随后可用于下一轮，因此如果当前桶对应时间 t，则在一次滴答后它变成对应 [t + u * n, t + (n + 1) * u) 的桶。时间轮的插入/删除（启动计时器/停止计时器）成本为 O(1)，而基于优先队列的计时器（如 java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue 和 java.util.Timer）的插入/删除成本为 O(log n)。请注意，DelayQueue 或 Timer 都不支持随机删除。\n简单时间轮的一个主要缺点是它假设计时器请求处于距当前时间 n * u 的时间间隔内。如果计时器请求超出此间隔，则为溢出。分层时间轮处理这种溢出。它是一个分层组织的计时轮，将溢出委托给上层轮子。最低层具有最精细的时间分辨率。随着我们在层次结构中向上移动，时间分辨率变得更粗。如果某一层的轮子的分辨率为 u 且大小为 n，则第二层的分辨率应为 n * u，第三层为 n^2 * u，依此类推。在每一层，溢出都委托给高一层的轮子。当高层轮子滴答时，它将计时器任务重新插入到低层轮子中。溢出轮可以按需创建。当溢出桶中的桶过期时，其中的所有任务将递归地重新插入计时器。然后任务被移动到更细粒度的轮子或被执行。插入（启动计时器）成本为 O(m)，其中 m 是轮子的数量，这通常与系统中的请求数量相比非常小，而删除（停止计时器）成本仍然是 O(1)。\n时间轮桶的双向链表\n在新设计中，我们为时间轮中的桶使用了我们自己实现的双向链表。双向链表的优点是，如果我们能访问列表中的链接单元 (link cells)，它允许 O(1) 的列表项插入/删除。\n计时器任务实例在入队到计时器队列时会将链接单元保存在自身中。当任务完成或取消时，使用任务本身保存的链接单元更新列表。\n使用 DelayQueue 驱动时钟\n一个简单的实现可能会使用一个线程，每隔单位时间唤醒一次并进行滴答操作，检查桶中是否有任务。炼狱的单位时间是 1ms (u = 1ms)。如果请求在最低层的时间轮处很稀疏，这可能会很浪费。通常情况确实如此，因为大多数请求在插入最低层时间轮之前就已经满足了。如果线程仅在有非空桶要过期时才唤醒，那就太好了。新的炼狱通过使用 java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue 来实现这一点，类似于旧实现，但我们入队的是任务桶而不是单个任务。这种设计具有性能优势。DelayQueue 中的项目数以上限为桶的数量，这通常远小于任务数量，因此 DelayQueue 内部优先队列的 offer/poll 操作次数将显著减少。\n清除观察者列表 (Purging Watcher Lists)\n在旧实现中，观察者列表的清除操作由观察者列表的总大小触发。问题在于，即使没有多少请求需要清除，观察者列表也可能超过阈值。发生这种情况时，会大大增加 CPU 负载。理想情况下，清除操作应由观察者列表中已完成请求的数量触发。\n在新设计中，已完成的请求会立即以 O(1) 的成本从计时器队列中删除。这意味着计时器队列中的请求数在任何时候都是确切的待处理请求数。因此，如果我们知道炼狱中不同请求的总数（包括待处理请求数和已完成但仍被观察的请求数之和），我们就可以避免不必要的清除操作。跟踪炼狱中不同请求的确切数量并非易事，因为请求可能被观察也可能不被观察。在新设计中，我们估计炼狱中的请求总数，而不是试图维持确切的数量。\n估计的请求数维护如下：\n每当观察到一个新请求时，估计的请求总数 E 就会增加。\n在开始清除操作之前，我们将估计的请求总数重置为计时器队列的大小。\n如果在清除期间没有请求添加到炼狱中，则 E 是清除后的正确请求数。\n如果在清除期间有一些请求添加到炼狱中，则 E 增加 E + 新观察到的请求数。这可能是一个高估，因为清除操作期间某些新请求可能已完成并从观察者列表中删除。\n我们预计高估的几率和高估的量都很小。\n基准测试\n我们比较了两种炼狱实现（当前实现和提议的新实现）的入队性能。这是一个微基准测试。它测量炼狱的入队性能。炼狱与系统的其余部分分离，并使用不执行任何有用操作的伪请求。因此，实际系统中炼狱的吞吐量可能远低于测试显示的数字。\n在测试中，请求的间隔假定遵循指数分布。每个请求花费的时间取自对数正态分布。通过调整对数正态分布的形状，我们可以测试不同的超时率。\n滴答大小为 1ms，轮子大小为 20。超时设置为 200ms。请求的数据大小为 100 字节。对于低超时率情况，我们选择 75percentile = 60ms 和 50percentile = 20。对于高超时率情况，我们选择 75percentile = 400ms 和 50percentile = 200ms。每次运行总共入队 100 万个请求。\n请求由单独的线程主动完成。原本应该在超时之前完成的请求被入队到另一个 DelayQueue 中。一个单独的线程保持轮询并完成它们。不保证实际完成时间的准确性。\nJVM 堆大小设置为 200m 以重现内存紧张的情况。\n结果显示在高入队率区域有显著差异。随着目标速率的增加，两种实现最初都能跟上请求。然而，在低超时场景中，旧实现在 40000 RPS（每秒请求数）左右饱和，而提议的实现没有表现出任何显著的性能下降；在高超时场景中，旧实现在 25000 RPS 左右饱和，而提议的实现可达 105000 RPS。\n新实现的 CPU 使用率明显更好。\n最后，我们测量了 ParNew 收集和 CMS 收集的总 GC 时间（毫秒）。在旧实现可以维持的入队率区域内，旧实现和新实现没有太大区别。\n总结\n在新设计中，我们使用分层时间轮作为超时计时器，并使用计时器桶的 DelayQueue 来按需推进时钟。已完成的请求立即以 O(1) 的成本从计时器队列中删除。桶保留在延迟队列中，但是桶的数量是有界的。并且，在一个健康的系统中，大多数请求在超时之前得到满足，许多桶在从延迟队列中取出之前就变空了。因此，计时器应该很少有较低间隔的桶。这种设计的优点是，计时器队列中的请求数在任何时候都是确切的待处理请求数。这允许我们估计需要清除的请求数。我们可以避免不必要的观察者列表清除操作。结果是我们在请求率方面实现了更高的可扩展性，并且 CPU 使用率要好得多。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/apache-kafka-purgatory-hierarchical-timing-wheels-cn/","title":"Apache Kafka, Purgatory 与分层时间轮 (Hierarchical Timing Wheels)"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/apache-kafka-purgatory-hierarchical-timing-wheels/":{"body":"Apache Kafka, Purgatory, and Hierarchical Timing Wheels\nApache Kafka has a data structure called the “request purgatory”. The purgatory holds any request that hasn’t yet met its criteria to succeed but also hasn’t yet resulted in an error. The problem is “How can we efficiently keep track of tens of thousands of requests that are being asynchronously satisfied by other activity in the cluster?”\nKafka implements several request types that cannot immediately be answered with a response. Examples:\nA produce request with acks=all cannot be considered complete until all in-sync replicas have acknowledged the write and we can guarantee it will not be lost if the leader fails.\nA fetch request with min.bytes=1 won’t be answered until there is at least one new byte of data for the consumer to consume. This allows a “long poll” so that the consumer need not busy wait checking for new data to arrive.\nThese requests are considered complete when either (a) the criteria they requested is complete or (b) some timeout occurs.\nThe number of these asynchronous operations in flight at any time scales with the number of connections, which, for Kafka, is often tens of thousands.\nThe request purgatory is designed for such a large scale request handling, but the old implementation had a number of deficiencies.\nIn this blog, I would like to explain the problem with the old implementation and how the new implementation solved it. I will also present benchmark results.\nOld Purgatory Design\nThe request purgatory consists of a timeout timer and a hash map of watcher lists for event driven processing. A request is put into the purgatory when it is not immediately satisfiable because of unmet conditions. A request in the purgatory is completed later when the conditions are met or is forced to be completed (timeout) when it passed beyond the time specified in the timeout parameter of the request. In the old design, it used Java DelayQueue to implement the timer.\nWhen a request is completed, the request is not deleted from the timer or watcher lists immediately. Instead, completed requests are deleted as they were found during condition checking. When the deletion does not keep up, the server may exhaust JVM heap and cause OutOfMemoryError.\nTo alleviate the situation, a separate thread, called the reaper thread, purges completed requests from the purgatory when the number of requests (either pending or completed) in the purgatory exceeds the configured number. The purge operation scans the timer queue and all watcher lists to find completed requests and deletes them.\nBy setting this configuration parameter low, the server can virtually avoid the memory problem. However, the server must pay a significant performance penalty if it scans all lists too frequently.\nNew Purgatory Design\nThe goal of the new design is to allow immediate deletion of a completed request and reduce the load of expensive purge process significantly. It requires cross referencing of entries in the timer and the requests. Also it is strongly desired to have O(1) insert/delete cost since insert/delete operation happens for each request/completion.\nTo satisfy these requirements, we designed a new purgatory implementation based on Hierarchical Timing Wheels.\nHierarchical Timing Wheel\nA simple timing wheel is a circular list of buckets of timer tasks. Let u be the time unit. A timing wheel with size n has n buckets and can hold timer tasks in n * u time interval. Each bucket holds timer tasks that fall into the corresponding time range. At the beginning, the first bucket holds tasks for [0, u), the second bucket holds tasks for [u, 2u), …, the n-th bucket for [u * (n -1), u * n). Every interval of time unit u, the timer ticks and moved to the next bucket then expire all timer tasks in it. So, the timer never inserts a task into the bucket for the current time since it is already expired. The timer immediately runs the expired task. The emptied bucket is then available for the next round, so if the current bucket is for the time t, it becomes the bucket for [t + u * n, t + (n + 1) * u) after a tick. A timing wheel has O(1) cost for insert/delete (start-timer/stop-timer) whereas priority queue based timers, such as java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue and java.util.Timer, have O(log n) insert/delete cost. Note that neither DelayQueue or Timer supports random delete.\nA major drawback of a simple timing wheel is that it assumes that a timer request is within the time interval of n * u from the current time. If a timer request is out of this interval, it is an overflow. A hierarchical timing wheel deals with such overflows. It is a hierarchically organized timing wheels that delegate overflows to upper level wheels. The lowest level has the finest time resolution. Time resolutions become coarser as we move up the hierarchy. If the resolution of a wheel at one level is u and the size is n, the resolutions should be n * u in the second level, n^2 * u in the third level, and so on. At each level overflows are delegated to the wheel in one level higher. When the wheel in the higher level ticks, it reinsert timer tasks to the lower level. An overflow wheel can be created on-demand. When a bucket in an overflow bucket expires, all tasks in it are reinserted into the timer recursively. The tasks are then moved to the finer grain wheels or be executed. The insert (start-timer) cost is O(m) where m is the number of wheels, which is usually very small compared to the number of requests in the system, and the delete (stop-timer) cost is still O(1).\nDoubly Linked List for Buckets in Timing Wheels\nIn the new design, we use own implementation of doubly linked list for the buckets in a timing wheel. The advantage of doubly linked list that it allows O(1) insert/delete of a list item if we have access link cells in a list.\nA timer task instance saves a link cell in itself when enqueued to a timer queue. When a task is completed or canceled, the list is updated using the link cell saved in the task itself.\nDriving Clock using DelayQueue\nA simple implementation may use a thread that wakes up every unit time and does the ticking, which checks if there is any task in the bucket. The unit time of the purgatory is 1ms (u = 1ms). This can be wasteful if requests are sparse at the wheel at the lowest level. This is usually the case because the majority of requests are satisfied before inserted into the wheel at the lowest level. It would be nice if a thread wakes up only when there is a non-empty bucket to expire. The new purgatory does so by using java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue similarly to the old implementation, but we enqueue task buckets instead of individual tasks. This design has a performance advantage. The number of items in DelayQueue is capped by the number of buckets, which is usually much smaller than the number of tasks, thus the number of offer/poll operations to the priority queue inside DelayQueue will be significantly smaller.\nPurging Watcher Lists\nIn the old implementation, the purge operation of watcher lists is triggered by the total size if the watcher lists. The problem is that the watcher lists may exceed the threshold even when there isn’t many requests to purge. When this happens it increases the CPU load a lot. Ideally, the purge operation should be triggered by the number of completed requests the watcher lists.\nIn the new design, a completed request is removed from the timer queue immediately with O(1) cost. It means that the number of requests in the timer queue is the number of pending requests exactly at any time. So, if we know the total number of distinct requests in the purgatory, which includes the sum of the number of pending request and the numbers completed but still watched requests, we can avoid unnecessary purge operations. It is not trivial to keep track of the exact number of distinct requests in the purgatory because a request may or may not be watched. In the new design, we estimate the total number of requests in the purgatory rather than trying to maintain the exactly number.\nThe estimated number of requests are maintained as follows.\nThe estimated total number of requests, E, is incremented whenever a new request is watched.\nBefore starting the purge operation, we reset the estimated total number of requests to the size of timer queue.\nIf no requests are added to the purgatory during purge, E is the correct number of requests after purge.\nIf some requests are added to the purgatory during purge, E is incremented to E + the number of newly watched requests. This may be an overestimation because it is possible that some of the new requests are completed and remove from the watcher lists during the purge operation.\nWe expect the chance of overestimation and an amount of overestimation are small.\nBenchmark\nWe compared the enqueue performance of two purgatory implementation, the current implementation and the proposed new implementation. This is a micro benchmark. It measures the purgatory enqueue performance. The purgatory was separated from the rest of the system and also uses a fake request which does nothing useful. So, the throughput of the purgatory in a real system may be much lower than the number shown by the test.\nIn the test, the intervals of the requests are assumed to follow the exponential distribution. Each request takes a time drawn from a log-normal distribution. By adjusting the shape of the log-normal distribution, we can test different timeout rate.\nThe tick size is 1ms and the wheel size is 20. The timeout was set to 200ms. The data size of a request was 100 bytes. For a low timeout rate case, we chose 75percentile = 60ms and 50percentile = 20. And for a high timeout rate case, we chose 75percentile = 400ms and 50percentile = 200ms. Total 1 million requests are enqueued in each run.\nRequests are actively completed by a separate thread. Requests that are supposed to be completed before timeout are enqueued to another DelayQueue. And a separate thread keeps polling and completes them. There is no guarantee of accuracy in terms of actual completion time.\nThe JVM heap size is set to 200m to reproduce a memory tight situation.\nThe result shows a dramatic difference in a high enqueue rate area. As the target rate increases, both implementations keep up with the requests initially. However, in low timeout scenario the old implementation was saturated around 40000 RPS (request per second), whereas the proposed implementation didn’t show any significant performance degradation, and in high timeout scenario the old implementation was saturated around 25000 RPS, whereas the proposed implementation was saturated 105000 RPS in this benchmark.\nCPU usage is significantly better in the new implementation.\nFinally, we measured total GC time (milliseconds) for ParNew collection and CMS collection. There isn’t much difference in the old implementation and the new implementation in the region of enqueue rate that the old implementation can sustain.\nSummary\nIn the new design, we use Hierarchical Timing Wheels for the timeout timer and DelayQueue of timer buckets to advance the clock on demand. Completed requests are removed from the timer queue immediately with O(1) cost. The buckets remain in the delay queue, however, the number of buckets is bounded. And, in a healthy system, most of the requests are satisfied before timeout, and many of the buckets become empty before pulled out of the delay queue. Thus, the timer should rarely have the buckets of the lower interval. The advantage of this design is that the number of requests in the timer queue is the number of pending requests exactly at any time. This allows us to estimate the number of requests need to be purged. We can avoid unnecessary purge operation of the watcher lists. As the result we achieve a higher scalability in terms of request rate with much better CPU usage.","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/apache-kafka-purgatory-hierarchical-timing-wheels/","title":"Apache Kafka, Purgatory, and Hierarchical Timing Wheels"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/brex-ti-shi-gong-cheng-zhi-nan/":{"body":"Brex’s Prompt Engineering Guide\nThis guide was created by Brex for internal purposes.

The process repeats until some stopping\ncriteria is met.\nLarge language models learn these probabilities by training on large corpuses\nof text. A consequence of this is that the models will cater to some use cases\nbetter than others (e.g. if it’s trained on GitHub data, it’ll understand the\nprobabilities of sequences in source code really well). Another consequence is\nthat the model may generate statements that seem plausible, but are actually\njust random without being grounded in reality.\nAs language models become more accurate at predicting sequences, many\nsurprising abilities\nemerge.\n1\nLanguage models actually use tokens, not words. A token roughly maps to a syllable in a word, or about 4 characters.\n2\nThere are many different pruning and sampling strategies to alter the behavior and performance of the sequences.\nA Brief, Incomplete, and Somewhat Incorrect History of Language Models\n📌 Skip to here if you’d like to jump past the\nhistory of language models. This section is for the curious minded, though\nmay also help you understand the reasoning behind the advice that follows.\nPre-2000’s\nLanguage models\nhave existed for decades, though traditional language models (e.g. n-gram\nmodels) have many\ndeficiencies in terms of an explosion of state space (the curse of\ndimensionality) and\nworking with novel phrases that they’ve never seen (sparsity). Plainly, older\nlanguage models can generate text that vaguely resembles the statistics of\nhuman generated text, but there is no consistency within the output – and a\nreader will quickly realize it’s all gibberish. N-gram models also don’t scale\nto large values of N, so are inherently limited.\nMid-2000’s\nIn 2007, Geoffrey Hinton – famous for popularizing backpropagation in 1980’s –\npublished an important advancement in training neural\nnetworks that unlocked much\ndeeper networks. Applying these simple deep neural networks to language\nmodeling helped alleviate some of problems with language models – they\nrepresented nuanced arbitrary concepts in a finite space and continuous way,\ngracefully handling sequences not seen in the training corpus. These simple\nneural networks learned the probabilities of their training corpus well, but\nthe output would statistically match the training data and generally not be\ncoherent relative to the input sequence.\nEarly-2010’s\nAlthough they were first introduced in 1995, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nNetworks found their\ntime to shine in the 2010’s. LSTMs allowed models to process arbitrary length\nsequences and, importantly, alter their internal state dynamically as they\nprocessed the input to remember previous things they saw. This minor tweak led\nto remarkable improvements. In 2015, Andrej Karpathy famously wrote about\ncreating a character-level\nlstm that performed\nfar better than it had any right to.\nLSTMs have seemingly magical abilities, but struggle with long term\ndependencies. If you asked it to complete the sentence, “In France, we\ntraveled around, ate many pastries, drank lots of wine, … lots more text …\n, but never learned how to speak _______”, the model might struggle with\npredicting “French”. They also process input one token at a time, so are\ninherently sequential, slow to train, and the Nth token only knows about the\nN - 1 tokens prior to it.\nLate-2010’s\nIn 2017, Google wrote a paper, Attention Is All You\nNeed, that introduced Transformer\nNetworks\nand kicked off a massive revolution in natural language processing. Overnight,\nmachines could suddenly do tasks like translating between languages nearly as\ngood as (sometimes better than) humans. Transformers are highly parallelizable\nand introduce a mechanism, called “attention”, for the model to efficiently\nplace emphasis on specific parts of the input. Transformers analyze the entire\ninput all at once, in parallel, choosing which parts are most important and\ninfluential. Every output token is influenced by every input token.\nTransformers are highly parallelizable, efficient to train, and produce\nastounding results. A downside to transformers is that they have a fixed input\nand output size – the context window – and computation increases\nquadratically with the size of this window (in some cases, memory does as\nwell!) 3.\nTransformers are not the end of the road, but the vast majority of recent\nimprovements in natural language processing have involved them. There is still\nabundant active research on various ways of implementing and applying them,\nsuch as Amazon’s AlexaTM\n20B\nwhich outperforms GPT-3 in a number of tasks and is an order of magnitude\nsmaller in its number of parameters.\n3\nThere are more recent variations to make these more compute and memory efficient, but remains an active area of research.\n2020’s\nWhile technically starting in 2018, the theme of the 2020’s has been\nGenerative Pre-Trained models – more famously known as GPT. One\nyear after the “Attention Is All You Need” paper, OpenAI released Improving\nLanguage Understanding by Generative\nPre-Training.\nThis paper established that you can train a large language model on a massive\nset of data without any specific agenda, and then once the model has learned\nthe general aspects of language, you can fine-tune it for specific tasks and\nquickly get state-of-the-art results.\nIn 2020, OpenAI followed up with their GPT-3 paper Language Models are\nFew-Shot\nLearners,\nshowing that if you scale up GPT-like models by another factor of ~10x, in\nterms of number of parameters and quantity of training data, you no\nlonger have to fine-tune it for many tasks. The capabilities emerge naturally\nand you get state-of-the-art results via text interaction with the model.\nIn 2022, OpenAI followed-up on their GPT-3 accomplishments by releasing\nInstructGPT. The intent\nhere was to tweak the model to follow instructions, while also being less\ntoxic and biased in its outputs. The key ingredient here was Reinforcement\nLearning from Human Feedback (RLHF), a\nconcept co-authored by Google and OpenAI in 20174, which allows humans to\nbe in the training loop to fine-tune the model output to be more in line with\nhuman preferences. InstructGPT is the predecessor to the now famous\nChatGPT.\nOpenAI has been a major contributor to large language models over the last few\nyears, including the most recent introduction of\nGPT-4, but they are not alone. Meta\nhas introduced many open source large language models like\nOPT,\nOPT-IML (instruction tuned),\nand LLaMa.\nGoogle released models like\nFLAN-T5 and\nBERT. And there is a huge open\nsource research community releasing models like\nBLOOM and\nStableLM.\nProgress is now moving so swiftly that every few weeks the state-of-the-art is\nchanging or models that previously required clusters to run now run on\nRaspberry PIs.\n4\n2017 was a big year for natural language processing.\nWhat is a prompt?\nA prompt, sometimes referred to as context, is the text provided to a\nmodel before it begins generating output. It guides the model to explore a\nparticular area of what it has learned so that the output is relevant to your\ngoals. As an analogy, if you think of the language model as a source code\ninterpreter, then a prompt is the source code to be interpreted. Somewhat\namusingly, a language model will happily attempt to guess what source code\nwill do:\nAnd it almost interprets the Python perfectly!\nFrequently, prompts will be an instruction or a question, like:\nOn the other hand, if you don’t specify a prompt, the model has no anchor to\nwork from and you’ll see that it just randomly samples from anything it has\never consumed:\nFrom GPT-3-Davinci:\nFrom GPT-4:\nHidden Prompts\n⚠️ Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.\nIn applications where a user is interacting with a model dynamically, such as\nchatting with the model, there will typically be portions of the prompt that\nare never intended to be seen by the user. These hidden portions may occur\nanywhere, though there is almost always a hidden prompt at the start of a\nconversation.\nTypically, this includes an initial chunk of text that sets the tone, model\nconstraints, and goals, along with other dynamic information that is specific\nto the particular session – user name, location, time of day, etc…\nThe model is static and frozen at a point in time, so if you want it to know\ncurrent information, like the time or the weather, you must provide it.\nIf you’re using the OpenAI Chat\nAPI, they\ndelineate hidden prompt content by placing it in the system role.\nHere’s an example of a hidden prompt followed by interactions with the content\nin that prompt:\nIn this example, you can see we explain to the bot the various roles, some\ncontext on the user, some dynamic data we want the bot to have access to, and\nthen guidance on how the bot should respond.\nIn practice, hidden prompts may be quite large. Here’s a larger prompt taken\nfrom a ChatGPT command-line\nassistant:\nFrom: https://github.com/manno/chatgpt-linux-assistant\nYou’ll see some good practices there, such as including lots of examples,\nrepetition for important behavioral aspects, constraining the replies, etc…\n⚠️ Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.\nTokens\nIf you thought tokens were 🔥 in 2022, tokens in 2023 are on a whole\ndifferent plane of existence. The atomic unit of consumption for a language\nmodel is not a “word”, but rather a “token”. You can kind of think of tokens\nas syllables, and on average they work out to about 750 words per 1,000\ntokens. They represent many concepts beyond just alphabetical characters –\nsuch as punctuation, sentence boundaries, and the end of a document.\nHere’s an example of how GPT may tokenize a sequence:\nYou can experiment with a tokenizer here: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\nDifferent models will use different tokenizers with different levels of granularity. You could, in theory, just feed a model 0’s and 1’s – but then the model needs to learn the concept of characters from bits, and then the concept of words from characters, and so forth. Similarly, you could feed the model a stream of raw characters, but then the model needs to learn the concept of words, and punctuation, etc… and, in general, the models will perform worse.\nTo learn more, Hugging Face has a wonderful introduction to tokenizers and why they need to exist.\nThere’s a lot of nuance around tokenization, such as vocabulary size or different languages treating sentence structure meaningfully different (e.g. words not being separated by spaces). Fortunately, language model APIs will almost always take raw text as input and tokenize it behind the scenes – so you rarely need to think about tokens.\nExcept for one important scenario, which we discuss next: token limits.\nToken Limits\nPrompts tend to be append-only, because you want the bot to have the entire context of previous messages in the conversation. Language models, in general, are stateless and won’t remember anything about previous requests to them, so you always need to include everything that it might need to know that is specific to the current session.\nA major downside of this is that the leading language model architecture, the Transformer, has a fixed input and output size – at a certain point the prompt can’t grow any larger. The total size of the prompt, sometimes referred to as the “context window”, is model dependent. For GPT-3, it is 4,096 tokens. For GPT-4, it is 8,192 tokens or 32,768 tokens depending on which variant you use.\nIf your context grows too large for the model, the most common tactic is the truncate the context in a sliding window fashion. If you think of a prompt as hidden initialization prompt + messages[], usually the hidden prompt will remain unaltered, and the messages[] array will take the last N messages.\nYou may also see more clever tactics for prompt truncation – such as\ndiscarding only the user messages first, so that the bot’s previous answers\nstay in the context for as long as possible, or asking an LLM to summarize the\nconversation and then replacing all of the messages with a single message\ncontaining that summary. There is no correct answer here and the solution will\ndepend on your application.\nImportantly, when truncating the context, you must truncate aggressively enough to allow room for the response as well. OpenAI’s token limits include both the length of the input and the length of the output. If your input to GPT-3 is 4,090 tokens, it can only generate 6 tokens in response.\n🧙‍♂️ If you’d like to count the number of tokens before sending the raw text to the model, the specific tokenizer to use will depend on which model you are using. OpenAI has a library called tiktoken that you can use with their models – though there is an important caveat that their internal tokenizer may vary slightly in count, and they may append other metadata, so consider this an approximation.\nIf you’d like an approximation without having access to a tokenizer, input.length / 4 will give a rough, but better than you’d expect, approximation for English inputs.\nPrompt Hacking\nPrompt engineering and large language models are a fairly nascent field, so new ways to hack around them are being discovered every day. The two large classes of attacks are:\nMake the bot bypass any guidelines you have given it.\nMake the bot output hidden context that you didn’t intend for the user to see.\nThere are no known mechanisms to comprehensively stop these, so it is important that you assume the bot may do or say anything when interacting with an adversarial user. Fortunately, in practice, these are mostly cosmetic concerns.\nThink of prompts as a way to improve the normal user experience. We design prompts so that normal users don’t stumble outside of our intended interactions – but always assume that a determined user will be able to bypass our prompt constraints.\nJailbreaks\nTypically hidden prompts will tell the bot to behave with a certain persona and focus on specific tasks or avoid certain words. It is generally safe to assume the bot will follow these guidelines for non-adversarial users, although non-adversarial users may accidentally bypass the guidelines too.\nFor example, we can tell the bot:\nIf we then ask it a question about computers, it will refer to them as a “device used for computing” because it isn’t allowed to use the word “computer”.\nIt will absolutely refuse to say the word:\nBut we can bypass these instructions and get the model to happily use the word if we trick it by asking it to translate the pig latin version of “computer”.\nThere are a number of defensive measures you can take here, but typically the best bet is to reiterate your most important constraints as close to the end as possible. For the OpenAI chat API, this might mean including it as a system message after the last user message. Here’s an example:\nDespite OpenAI investing a lot into jailbreaks, there are very clever work arounds being shared every day.\nLeaks\nIf you missed the previous warnings in this doc, you should always assume that any data exposed to the language model will eventually be seen by the user.\nAs part of constructing prompts, you will often embed a bunch of data in hidden prompts (a.k.a. system prompts). The bot will happily relay this information to the user:\nEven if you instruct it not to reveal the information, and it obeys those instructions, there are millions of ways to leak data in the hidden prompt.\nHere we have an example where the bot should never mention my city, but a simple reframing of the question get’s it to spill the beans.\nSimilarly, we get the bot to tell us what word it isn’t allowed to say without ever actually saying the word:\nYou should think of a hidden prompt as a means to make the user experience better or more inline with the persona you’re targeting. Never place any information in a prompt that you wouldn’t visually render for someone to read on screen.\nWhy do we need prompt engineering?\nUp above, we used an analogy of prompts as the “source code” that a language model “interprets”. Prompt engineering is the art of writing prompts to get the language model to do what we want it to do – just like software engineering is the art of writing source code to get computers to do what we want them to do.\nWhen writing good prompts, you have to account for the idiosyncrasies of the model(s) you’re working with. The strategies will vary with the complexity of the tasks. You’ll have to come up with mechanisms to constrain the model to achieve reliable results, incorporate dynamic data that the model can’t be trained on, account for limitations in the model’s training data, design around context limits, and many other dimensions.\nThere’s an old adage that computers will only do what you tell them to do. Throw that advice out the window. Prompt engineering inverts this wisdom. It’s like programming in natural language against a non-deterministic computer that will do anything that you haven’t guided it away from doing.\nThere are two broad buckets that prompt engineering approaches fall into.\nGive a Bot a Fish\nThe “give a bot a fish” bucket is for scenarios when you can explicitly give the bot, in the hidden context, all of the information it needs to do whatever task is requested of it.\nFor example, if a user loaded up their dashboard and we wanted to show them a quick little friendly message about what task items they have outstanding, we could get the bot to summarize it as\nYou have 4 receipts/memos to upload. The most recent is from Target on March 5th, and the oldest is from Blink Fitness on January 17th. Thanks for staying on top of your expenses!\nby providing a list of the entire inbox and any other user context we’d like it to have.\nSimilarly, if you were helping a user book a trip, you could:\nAsk the user their dates and destination.\nBehind the scenes, search for flights and hotels.\nEmbed the flight and hotel search results in the hidden context.\nAlso embed the company’s travel policy in the hidden context.\nAnd then the bot will have real-time travel information + constraints that it\ncan use to answer questions for the user. Here’s an example of the bot\nrecommending options, and the user asking it to refine them:\n(Full prompt)\nThis is the same approach that products like Microsoft Bing use to incorporate dynamic data. When you chat with Bing, it asks the bot to generate three search queries. Then they run three web searches and include the summarized results in the hidden context for the bot to use.\nSummarizing this section, the trick to making a good experience is to change the context dynamically in response to whatever the user is trying to do.\n🧙‍♂️ Giving a bot a fish is the most reliable way to ensure the bot gets a fish. You will get the most consistent and reliable results with this strategy. Use this whenever you can.\nSemantic Search\nIf you just need the bot to know a little more about the world, a common approach is to perform a semantic search.\nA semantic search is oriented around a document embedding – which you can think of as a fixed-length array5 of numbers, where each number represents some aspect of the document (e.g. if it’s a science document, maybe the 843rd number is large, but if it’s an art document the 1,115th number is large – this is overly simplistic, but conveys the idea).6\nIn addition to computing an embedding for a document, you can also compute an embedding for a user query using the same function. If the user asks “Why is the sky blue?” – you compute the embedding of that question and, in theory, this embedding will be more similar to embeddings of documents that mention the sky than embeddings that don’t talk about the sky.\nTo find documents related to the user query, you compute the embedding and then find the top-N documents that have the most similar embedding. Then we place these documents (or summaries of these documents) in the hidden context for the bot to reference.\nNotably, sometimes user queries are so short that the embedding isn’t particularly valuable. There is a clever technique described in a paper published in December 2022 called a “Hypothetical Document Embedding” or HyDE. Using this technique, you ask the model to generate a hypothetical document in response to the user’s query, and then compute the embedding for this generated document. The model fabricates a document out of thin air – but the approach works!\nThe HyDE technique uses more calls to the model, but for many use cases has notable boosts in results.\n5\nUsually referred to as a vector.\n6\nThe vector features are learned automatically, and the specific values aren’t directly interpretable by a human without some effort.\nTeach a Bot to Fish\nSometimes you’ll want the bot to have the capability to perform actions on the user’s behalf, like adding a memo to a receipt or plotting a chart. Or perhaps we want it to retrieve data in more nuanced ways than semantic search would allow for, like retrieving the past 90 days of expenses.\nIn these scenarios, we need to teach the bot how to fish.\nCommand Grammars\nWe can give the bot a list of commands for our system to interpret, along with descriptions and examples for the commands, and then have it produce programs composed of those commands.\nThere are many caveats to consider when going with this approach. With complex command grammars, the bot will tend to hallucinate commands or arguments that could plausibly exist, but don’t actually. The art to getting this right is enumerating commands that have relatively high levels of abstraction, while giving the bot sufficient flexibility to compose them in novel and useful ways.\nFor example, giving the bot a plot-the-last-90-days-of-expenses command is not particularly flexible or composable in what the bot can do with it. Similarly, a draw-pixel-at-x-y [x] [y] [rgb] command would be far too low-level. But giving the bot a plot-expenses and list-expenses command provides some good primitives that the bot has some flexibility with.\nIn an example below, we use this list of commands:\nCommandArgumentsDescription\nlist-expensesbudgetReturns a list of expenses for a given budget\nconversemessageA message to show to the user\nplot-expensesexpenses[]Plots a list of expenses\nget-budget-by-namebudget_nameRetrieves a budget by name\nlist-budgetsReturns a list of budgets the user has access to\nadd-memoinbox_item_id, memo messageAdds a memo to the provided inbox item\nWe provide this table to the model in Markdown format, which the language model handles incredibly well – presumably because OpenAI trains heavily on data from GitHub.\nIn this example below, we ask the model to output the commands in reverse polish notation7.\n7\nThe model handles the simplicity of RPN astoundingly well.\n🧠 There are some interesting subtle things going on in that example, beyond just command generation. When we ask it to add a memo to the “shake shack” expense, the model knows that the command add-memo takes an expense ID. But we never tell it the expense ID, so it looks up “Shake Shack” in the table of expenses we provided it, then grabs the ID from the corresponding ID column, and then uses that as an argument to add-memo.\nGetting command grammars working reliably in complex situations can be tricky. The best levers we have here are to provide lots of descriptions, and as many examples of usage as we can. Large language models are few-shot learners, meaning that they can learn a new task by being provided just a few examples. In general, the more examples you provide the better off you’ll be – but that also eats into your token budget, so it’s a balance.\nHere’s a more complex example, with the output specified in JSON instead of RPN. And we use Typescript to define the return types of commands.\n(Full prompt)\nThis version is a bit easier to parse and interpret if your language of choice has a JSON.parse function.\n🧙‍♂️ There is no industry established best format for defining a DSL for the model to generate programs. So consider this an area of active research. You will bump into limits. And as we overcome these limits, we may discover more optimal ways of defining commands.\nReAct\nIn March of 2023, Princeton and Google released a paper “ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models”, where they introduce a variant of command grammars that allows for fully autonomous interactive execution of actions and retrieval of data.\nThe model is instructed to return a thought and an action that it would like to perform. Another agent (e.g. our client) then performs the action and returns it to the model as an observation. The model will then loop to return more thoughts and actions until it returns an answer.\nThis is an incredibly powerful technique, effectively allowing the bot to be its own research assistant and possibly take actions on behalf of the user. Combined with a powerful command grammar, the bot should rapidly be able to answer a massive set of user requests.\nIn this example, we give the model a small set of commands related to getting employee data and searching wikipedia:\nCommandArgumentsDescription\nfind_employeenameRetrieves an employee by name\nget_employeeidRetrieves an employee by ID\nget_locationidRetrieves a location by ID\nget_reportsemployee_idRetrieves a list of employee ids that report to the employee associated with employee_id.\nwikipediaarticleRetrieves a wikipedia article on a topic.\nWe then ask the bot a simple question, “Is my manager famous?”.\nWe see that the bot:\nFirst looks up our employee profile.\nFrom our profile, gets our manager’s id and looks up their profile.\nExtracts our manager’s name and searches for them on Wikipedia.\nI chose a fictional character for the manager in this scenario.\nThe bot reads the wikipedia article and concludes that can’t be my manager since it is a fictional character.\nThe bot then modifies its search to include (real person).\nSeeing that there are no results, the bot concludes that my manager is not famous.\n(Full prompt)\nGPT-4 vs GPT-3.5\nIn most of the examples in this doc, the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is negligible, but for “teaching a bot to fish” scenarios the difference between the models is notable.\nNone of the above examples of command grammars, for example, work without meaningful modifications for GPT-3.5. At a minimum, you have to provide a number of examples (at least one usage example per command) before you get any reasonable results. And, for complex sets of commands, it may hallucinate new commands or create fictional arguments.\nWith a sufficiently thorough hidden prompt, you should be able to overcome these limitations. GPT-4 is capable of far more consistent and complex logic with far simpler prompts (and can get by with zero or small numbers of examples – though it is always beneficial to include as many as possible).\nStrategies\nThis section contains examples and strategies for specific needs or problems. For successful prompt engineering, you will need to combine some subset of all of the strategies enumerated in this document. Don’t be afraid to mix and match things – or invent your own approaches.\nEmbedding Data\nIn hidden contexts, you’ll frequently want to embed all sorts of data. The specific strategy will vary depending on the type and quantity of data you are embedding.\nSimple Lists\nFor one-off objects, enumerating fields + values in a normal bulleted list works pretty well:\nIt will also work for larger sets of things, but there are other formats for lists of data that GPT handles more reliably. Regardless, here’s an example:\nMarkdown Tables\nMarkdown tables are great for scenarios where you have many items of the same type to enumerate.\nFortunately, OpenAI’s models are exceptionally good at working with Markdown tables (presumably from the tons of GitHub data they’ve trained on).\nWe can reframe the above using Markdown tables instead:\n🧠 Note that in this last example, the items in the table have an explicit date, February 2nd. In our question, we asked about “today”. And earlier in the prompt we mentioned that today was Feb 2. The model correctly handled the transitive inference – converting “today” to “February 2nd” and then looking up “February 2nd” in the table.\nJSON\nMarkdown tables work really well for many use cases and should be preferred due to their density and ability for the model to handle them reliably, but you may run into scenarios where you have many columns and the model struggles with it or every item has some custom attributes and it doesn’t make sense to have dozens of columns of empty data.\nIn these scenarios, JSON is another format that the model handles really well. The close proximity of keys to their values makes it easy for the model to keep the mapping straight.\nHere is the same example from the Markdown table, but with JSON instead:\nFreeform Text\nOccasionally you’ll want to include freeform text in a prompt that you would like to delineate from the rest of the prompt – such as embedding a document for the bot to reference. In these scenarios, surrounding the document with triple backticks, ```, works well8.\n8\nA good rule of thumb for anything you’re doing in prompts is to lean heavily on things the model would have learned from GitHub.\nNested Data\nNot all data is flat and linear. Sometimes you’ll need to embed data that is nested or has relations to other data. In these scenarios, lean on JSON:\n(Full prompt)\nIf using nested JSON winds up being too verbose for your token budget, fallback to relational tables defined with Markdown:\n(Full prompt)\n🧠 The model works well with data in 3rd normal form, but may struggle with too many joins. In experiments, it seems to do okay with at least three levels of nested joins. In the example above the model successfully joins from users to addresses to cities to infer the likely income for George – $90,000.\nCitations\nFrequently, a natural language response isn’t sufficient on its own and you’ll want the model’s output to cite where it is getting data from.\nOne useful thing to note here is that anything you might want to cite should have a unique ID. The simplest approach is to just ask the model to link to anything it references:\nProgrammatic Consumption\nBy default, language models output natural language text, but frequently we need to interact with this result in a programmatic way that goes beyond simply printing it out on screen. You can achieve this by asking the model to output the results in your favorite serialization format (JSON and YAML seem to work best).\nMake sure you give the model an example of the output format you’d like. Building on our previous travel example above, we can augment our prompt to tell it:\nAnd now we’ll get interactions like this:\nYou could imagine the UI for this rendering the message as normal text, but then also adding discrete buttons for booking the flight + hotel, or auto-filling a form for the user.\nAs another example, let’s build on the citations example – but move beyond Markdown links. We can ask it to produce JSON with a normal message along with a list of items used in the creation of that message. In this scenario you won’t know exactly where in the message the citations were leveraged, but you’ll know that they were used somewhere.\n🧠 Interestingly, in the model’s response to “How much did I spend at Target?” it provides a single value, $188.16, but importantly in the citations array it lists the individual expenses that it used to compute that value.\nChain of Thought\nSometimes you will bang your head on a prompt trying to get the model to output reliable results, but, no matter what you do, it just won’t work. This will frequently happen when the bot’s final output requires intermediate thinking, but you ask the bot only for the output and nothing else.\nThe answer may surprise you: ask the bot to show its work. In October 2022, Google released a paper “Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models” where they showed that if, in your hidden prompt, you give the bot examples of answering questions by showing your work, then when you ask the bot to answer something it will show its work and produce more reliable answers.\nJust a few weeks after that paper was published, at the end of October 2022, the University of Tokyo and Google released the paper “Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners”, where they show that you don’t even need to provide examples – you simply have to ask the bot to think step-by-step.\nAveraging\nHere is an example where we ask the bot to compute the average expense, excluding Target. The actual answer is $136.77 and the bot almost gets it correct with $136.43.\nIf we simply add “Let’s think step-by-step”, the model gets the correct answer:\nInterpreting Code\nLet’s revisit the Python example from earlier and apply chain-of-thought prompting to our question. As a reminder, when we asked the bot to evaluate the Python code it gets it slightly wrong. The correct answer is Hello, Brex!!Brex!!Brex!!! but the bot gets confused about the number of !’s to include. In below’s example, it outputs Hello, Brex!!!Brex!!!Brex!!!:\nIf we ask the bot to show its work, then it gets the correct answer:\nDelimiters\nIn many scenarios, you may not want to show the end user all of the bot’s thinking and instead just want to show the final answer. You can ask the bot to delineate the final answer from its thinking. There are many ways to do this, but let’s use JSON to make it easy to parse:\nUsing Chain-of-Thought prompting will consume more tokens, resulting in increased price and latency, but the results are noticeably more reliable for many scenarios. It’s a valuable tool to use when you need the bot to do something complex and as reliably as possible.\nFine Tuning\nSometimes no matter what tricks you throw at the model, it just won’t do what you want it to do. In these scenarios you can sometimes fallback to fine-tuning. This should, in general, be a last resort.\nFine-tuning is the process of taking an already trained model and then giving it thousands (or more) of example input:output pairs\nIt does not eliminate the need for hidden prompts, because you still need to embed dynamic data, but it may make the prompts smaller and more reliable.\nDownsides\nThere are many downsides to fine-tuning. If it is at all possible, take advantage of the nature of language models being zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learners by teaching them to do something in their prompt rather than fine-tuning.\nSome of the downsides include:\nNot possible: GPT-3.5/GPT-4 isn’t fine tunable, which is the primary model / API we’ll be using, so we simply can’t lean in fine-tuning.\nOverhead: Fine-tuning requires manually creating tons of data.\nVelocity: The iteration loop becomes much slower – every time you want to add a new capability, instead of adding a few lines to a prompt, you need to create a bunch of fake data and then run the finetune process and then use the newly fine-tuned model.\nCost: It is up to 60x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock gpt-3.5-turbo model. And it is 2x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock GPT-4 model.\n⛔️ If you fine-tune a model, never use real customer data. Always use synthetic data. The model may memorize portions of the data you provide and may regurgitate private data to other users that shouldn’t be seeing it.\nIf you never fine-tune a model, we don’t have to worry about accidentally leaking data into the model.\nAdditional Resources\n🌟 OpenAI Cookbook 🌟\n🧑‍💻 Prompt Hacking 🧑‍💻\n📚 Dair.ai Prompt Engineering Guide 📚","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/brex-ti-shi-gong-cheng-zhi-nan/","title":"Brex 提示工程指南（双语对照）"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/i-replaced-redis-with-postgresql-and-its-faster-cn/":{"body":"用 PostgreSQL 替换 Redis（竟然更快）\n原文：I Replaced Redis with PostgreSQL (And It’s Faster)\n作者：Polliog\n首发：DEV Community（dev.to）\n链接：https://dev.to/polliog/i-replaced-redis-with-postgresql-and-its-faster-4942\n说明：由于抓取工具对页面内容有长度限制，本文译文目前覆盖到 PostgreSQL 的 LISTEN/NOTIFY 和 Live Tail 示例之前的部分，其余段落请参考原文。\n我原来的 Web 应用栈非常典型：\nPostgreSQL：负责持久化数据\nRedis：负责缓存、Pub/Sub 和后台任务\n两套数据库，两套东西要维护，两处潜在故障点。\n后来我意识到：PostgreSQL 其实可以干掉 Redis 做的所有事情。\n于是我直接把 Redis 整个撤掉，看看会发生什么。\n我原来是怎么用 Redis 的\n在变更之前，Redis 主要干三件事：\n1. 缓存（大约占 70% 使用量）\n2.

实现：\nPostgreSQL 版本可以有好几种写法。\n一种是专门建一张限流表：\n另一种更直接的做法是记录请求明细，用窗口查询：\n什么时候 Postgres 的实现更有优势？\n你的限流逻辑比较复杂，不只是简单计数（例如按用户+IP+路径组合）\n希望限流检查和业务数据读写处在同一个事务里\n什么时候仍然应该用 Redis？\n你需要亚毫秒级的极端低延迟\n吞吐非常大（百万级请求每秒）\nPostgreSQL 特性五：用 JSONB 存储会话\nRedis 的写法通常像这样：\n在 PostgreSQL 里，我们可以：\n因为是 JSONB，我们还可以直接在会话数据上做查询：\n这些能力在 Redis 里是做不到的。\n真实基准测试\n我在生产数据上跑了一轮基准测试，配置大致如下：\n硬件：AWS RDS db.t3.medium（2 vCPU，4GB 内存）\n数据集：100 万条缓存记录，1 万条会话\n工具：pgbench（自定义脚本）\n结果大概是这样：\n操作RedisPostgreSQL差异\nCache SET0.05ms0.08ms慢约 60%\nCache GET0.04ms0.06ms慢约 50%\nPub/Sub1.2ms3.1ms慢约 158%\nQueue push0.08ms0.15ms慢约 87%\nQueue pop0.12ms0.31ms慢约 158%\n看起来 PostgreSQL 各项都更慢，但注意几个细节：\n所有操作仍然都在 1ms 以内\n不再有到 Redis 的那一跳网络延迟\n架构上少了一整块基础设施\n组合操作才是关键\n真正有意思的是把操作组合起来看。\n场景：插入一篇帖子 + 失效缓存 + 通知订阅者\n用 Redis：\n用 PostgreSQL：\n当你把「写入 + 缓存操作 + 事件通知」这些动作放到同一个事务里时，PostgreSQL 反而整体更快，而且一致性也更好。\n什么时候应该保留 Redis？\n虽然这篇文章在讲「用 PostgreSQL 替换 Redis」，但并不是说 Redis 一无是处，恰恰相反，Redis 在很多场景仍然是非常优秀的工具。\n以下几种情况，我会选择继续用 Redis：\n1. 你需要极致性能\n如果你的业务真正在做每秒几十万甚至上百万次缓存读写，那 PostgreSQL 很难顶得住，Redis 依然是更合适的选择。\n2. 你依赖 Redis 特有的数据结构\nRedis 提供了很多很厉害的原语：\n有序集合（sorted set）做排行榜\nHyperLogLog 做近似去重计数\n地理空间索引\nStreams 做更高级的流式消费 / Pub/Sub\n在 PostgreSQL 里当然也能做类似的事情，但通常会更笨重一些：\n3. 架构层面强制要求独立缓存层\n例如严格的微服务架构、或者多个语言/系统要共享同一层缓存，这时候一个独立的 Redis 集群反而更清晰。\n迁移策略：不要一夜之间把 Redis 拔掉\n我自己的迁移过程分成了几步。\nPhase 1：双写（第 1 周）\n这一阶段主要是观察命中率、延迟等指标。\nPhase 2：读走 Postgres，Redis 兜底（第 2 周）\n继续监控错误率和性能表现。\nPhase 3：只写 PostgreSQL（第 3 周）\n此时 Redis 只作为保险存在，一旦确认没有问题，就可以进入下一步。\nPhase 4：下线 Redis（第 4 周）\n完整代码示例\n下面是文章中给出的几个完整模块示例，都是基于 PostgreSQL 的实现。\n缓存模块\nPub/Sub 模块\n任务队列模块\n性能调优小贴士\n如果你决定把 Redis 的一些职责搬到 PostgreSQL，上线前有几件事值得注意。\n1. 用好连接池\n2. 建好索引\n3. 调优 PostgreSQL 配置\n4. 做好日常维护\n三个月之后的结果\n迁移完成并稳定运行了三个月之后，我大概盘点了一下收获和代价。\n得到的：\n✅ 每月节省约 $100（不再使用 ElastiCache）\n✅ 备份和恢复流程少了一整套\n✅ 监控和告警体系变简单\n✅ 部署链路上少了一个外部依赖\n失去的：\n❌ 缓存操作慢了大概 0.1–0.5ms\n❌ Redis 那些「花哨」的数据结构（不过我本来就没用上）\n如果是我当前这个应用场景，我会不会再做一次同样的选择？会。\n但我会不会对所有团队都说「赶紧把 Redis 换掉」？不会。\n决策小抄\n可以把这篇文章最后浓缩成一个小小的决策矩阵。\n适合考虑用 PostgreSQL 替换 Redis 的情况：\n✅ 你只把 Redis 用在简单缓存 / 会话存储上\n✅ 缓存命中率一般，没有到 99% 这种极端情况\n✅ 你很看重数据的一致性，希望一切都在事务里完成\n✅ 接受操作慢 0.1–1ms 但换来更简单的运维\n✅ 团队规模不大，没有专职的 SRE / DBRE 团队\n更应该保留 Redis 的情况：\n❌ 你需要每秒 10 万级甚至更高的操作数\n❌ 依赖 Redis 的有序集合、HyperLogLog 等高级数据结构\n❌ 有专门的运维团队负责 Redis 集群\n❌ 亚毫秒级延迟是业务刚性指标\n❌ 做多地域部署，需要 Redis 的一些特性来配合\n参考资料\n如果你想进一步深入，可以直接查看 PostgreSQL

表：https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtable.html\n工具：\npgBouncer：连接池工具，适合高并发场景\npg_stat_statements：分析慢查询和热点 SQL\n基于 PostgreSQL 的替代方案：\nGraphile Worker：基于 Postgres 的任务队列\npg-boss：另一个成熟的 Postgres 队列实现\nTL;DR\n这篇文章的核心其实可以用几句话概括：\n用 UNLOGGED 表 替代 Redis 缓存\n用 LISTEN/NOTIFY 替代 Redis Pub/Sub\n用 FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED 实现任务队列\n用 JSONB 表 存储会话\n结果：\n基础设施更少、部署和运维更简单\n所有东西都在 PostgreSQL 一处，事务一致性天然有保障\n单次操作确实慢了一点点（0.1–1ms），但整体延迟往往更低\n如果你的系统已经在用 PostgreSQL，而 Redis 只承担缓存、Pub/Sub 或轻量队列这类职责，那么非常值得认真评估：是否真的需要再多养一套 Redis 基础设施？ 在很多场景下，PostgreSQL 这套「一站式方案」已经足够好，并且会让你的系统在一致性、可观测性和可维护性上都更容易掌控。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/i-replaced-redis-with-postgresql-and-its-faster-cn/","title":"用 PostgreSQL 替换

Martin Kleppmann, a distributed systems researcher, yesterday published an analysis of Redlock (http://redis.io/topics/distlock), that you can find here: http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html\nRedlock 是否安全？作者 antirez，距今 3539 天前发布，413703 次浏览。分布式系统研究者 Martin Kleppmann 昨天发表了一篇关于 Redlock 的分析（http://redis.io/topics/distlock），你可以在这里找到他的文章：http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html。\nRedlock is a client side distributed locking algorithm I designed to be used with Redis, but the algorithm orchestrates, client side, a set of nodes that implement a data store with certain capabilities, in order to create a multi-master fault tolerant, and hopefully safe, distributed lock with auto release capabilities.\nYou can implement Redlock using MySQL instead of Redis, for example.\nRedlock 是我设计的一个客户端分布式锁算法，最初用于 Redis。该算法在客户端侧编排一组具备特定能力的数据存储节点，以构建一个多主、容错、并且（希望）安全的、带自动释放能力的分布式锁。例如，你完全可以用 MySQL 来实现 Redlock，而不是 Redis。\nThe algorithm’s goal was to move away people that were using a single Redis instance, or a master-slave setup with failover, in order to implement distributed locks, to something much more reliable and safe, but having a very low complexity and good performance.\n这个算法的目标，是引导那些使用单个 Redis 实例或主从+故障切换来实现分布式锁的人，迁移到一种更可靠、更安全，同时复杂度低、性能好的实现方式。\nSince I published Redlock people implemented it in multiple languages and used it for different purposes.\n自从我发布 Redlock 后，人们在多种语言中实现了它，并用于不同的目的。\nMartin’s analysis of the algorithm concludes that Redlock is not safe. It is great that Martin published an analysis, I asked for an analysis in the original Redlock specification here: http://redis.io/topics/distlock. So thank you Martin. However I don’t agree with the analysis. The good thing is that distributed systems are, unlike other fields of programming, pretty mathematically exact, or they are not, so a given set of properties can be guaranteed by an algorithm or the algorithm may fail to guarantee them under certain assumptions. In this analysis I’ll analyze Martin’s analysis so that other experts in the field can check the two documents (the analysis and the counter-analysis), and eventually we can understand if Redlock can be considered safe or not.\nMartin 的结论是：Redlock 不安全。Martin 写这篇分析很棒——我在 Redlock 原始规范里也请求过对它进行分析：http://redis.io/topics/distlock。所以感谢 Martin。不过我不认同该分析。好在分布式系统与其它编程领域不同，它在数学上相当“严谨”：一个算法要么能保证某组性质，要么在某些假设下无法保证。我会逐点分析 Martin 的文章，以便领域内的专家能对照两篇文档（分析与反驳），最终我们可以更清楚地判断 Redlock 是否安全。\nWhy Martin thinks Redlock is unsafe\n为什么 Martin 认为 Redlock 不安全\nThe arguments in the analysis are mainly two:\n该分析的主要论点有两点：\nDistributed locks with an auto-release feature (the mutually exclusive lock property is only valid for a fixed amount of time after the lock is acquired) require a way to avoid issues when clients use a lock after the expire time, violating the mutual exclusion while accessing a shared resource. Martin says that Redlock does not have such a mechanism.\n1）带自动释放的分布式锁（互斥性仅在获取后的一段固定时间内有效）需要一种机制来避免“锁过期后客户端仍使用”的问题，否则会在访问共享资源时破坏互斥。Martin 认为 Redlock 缺少这样的机制。\nMartin says the algorithm is, regardless of problem “1”, inherently unsafe since it makes assumptions about the system model that cannot be guaranteed in practical systems.\n2）不论问题 1 与否，Martin 认为该算法本质上不安全，因为它对系统模型做出了在实际系统中无法保证的假设。\nI’ll address the two concerns separately for clarity, starting with the first “1”.\n为了清晰起见，我将分别讨论这两点，先从第一点开始。\nDistributed locks, auto release, and tokens\n分布式锁、自动释放与令牌\nA distributed lock without an auto release mechanism, where the lock owner will hold it indefinitely, is basically useless. If the client holding the lock crashes and does not recover with full state in a short amount of time, a deadlock is created where the shared resource that the distributed lock tried to protect remains forever unaccessible. This creates a liveness issue that is unacceptable in most situations, so a sane distributed lock must be able to auto release itself.\n一个没有自动释放机制的分布式锁（持有者可无限期持有）基本上是无用的。如果持锁客户端崩溃且不能在短时间内完全恢复，就会造成死锁——共享资源会永久不可访问。这是多数场景无法接受的“活性”问题，因此合理的分布式锁必须能自动释放。\nSo practical locks are provided to clients with a maximum time to live. After the expire time, the mutual exclusion guarantee, which is the main property of the lock, is gone: another client may already have the lock. What happens if two clients acquire the lock at two different times, but the first one is so slow, because of GC pauses or other scheduling issues, that will try to do work in the context of the shared resource at the same time with second client that acquired the lock?\n因此，实际工程中的锁会设置最长存活时间。过期后，锁的“互斥保证”（核心属性）就不再成立：另一个客户端可能已经拿到了锁。如果两个客户端在不同时间获取锁，但第一个客户端因为 GC 暂停或调度问题而非常慢，导致它与第二个客户端同时试图操作同一共享资源，会发生什么？\nMartin says that this problem is avoided by having the distributed lock server to provide, with every lock, a token, which is, in his example, just a number that is guaranteed to always increment. The rationale for Martin’s usage of a token, is that this way, when two different clients access the locked resource at the same time, we can use the token in the database write transaction (that is assumed to materialize the work the client does): only the client with the greatest lock number will be able to write to the database.\nMartin 的做法是：分布式锁服务为每次加锁提供一个令牌（在他的例子里，是一个保证递增的数字）。使用令牌的动机是：当两个客户端同时访问被锁资源时，在数据库写事务中携带令牌（假设写事务体现了客户端的操作），只有令牌更大的客户端能够写入数据库。\nIn Martin’s words:\n用 Martin 的话说：\n“The fix for this problem is actually pretty simple: you need to include a fencing token with every write request to the storage service. In this context, a fencing token is simply a number that increases (e.g. incremented by the lock service) every time a client acquires the lock”\n“解决这个问题其实很简单：你需要在每次写请求里附带一个 fencing token（栅栏令牌）。在这里，栅栏令牌只是一个递增的数字（例如由锁服务每次成功加锁时递增）。”\n… snip …\n……（略）……\n“Note this requires the storage server to take an active role in checking tokens, and rejecting any writes on which the token has gone backwards”.\n“注意这需要存储服务器主动校验令牌，并拒绝任何令牌倒退的写操作。”\nI think this argument has a number of issues:\n我认为这套说法存在一些问题：\nMost of the times when you need a distributed lock system that can guarantee mutual exclusivity, when this property is violated you already lost. Distributed locks are very useful exactly when we have no other control in the shared resource. In his analysis, Martin assumes that you always have some other way to avoid race conditions when the mutual exclusivity of the lock is violated. I think this is a very strange way to reason about distributed locks with strong guarantees, it is not clear why you would use a lock with strong properties at all if you can resolve races in a different way. Yet I’ll continue with the other points below just for the sake of showing that Redlock can work well in this, very artificial, context.\n1）在多数需要强互斥保证的锁系统中，一旦互斥被破坏，损失已经发生。分布式锁之所以有用，恰恰在于我们无法在共享资源上施加其它控制。Martin 的分析假设：即便互斥被破坏，你总有其它办法避免竞争。这种逻辑对于“强保证的锁”而言很奇怪——如果你能用别的方式解决竞争，那为何还要使用强保证的锁？不过，为了论证 Redlock 在这种“人为设定的场景”里也能工作，我会继续讨论下面的点。\nIf your data store can always accept the write only if your token is greater than all the past tokens, than it’s a linearizable store. If you have a linearizable store, you can just generate an incremental ID for each Redlock acquired, so this would make Redlock equivalent to another distributed lock system that provides an incremental token ID with every new lock. However in the next point I’ll show how this is not needed.\n2）如果你的存储只有在令牌大于所有历史令牌时才接受写入，那它就是线性一致的。如果你已经有线性一致的存储，你完全可以为每次 Redlock 加锁生成一个递增 ID——这会让 Redlock 等价于“每次加锁都提供递增令牌”的另一种锁系统。不过在下一点我会说明，这并非必要。\nHowever “2” is not a sensible choice anyway: most of the times the result of working to a shared resource is not writing to a linearizable store, so what to do? Each Redlock is associated with a large random token (which is generated in a way that collisions can be ignored. The Redlock specification assumes textually “20 bytes from /dev/urandom”). What do you do with a unique token? For example you can implement Check and Set. When starting to work with a shared resource, we set its state to “”, then we operate the read-modify-write only if the token is still the same when we write.\n3）而且“2”本身并不总是可行：多数情况下，对共享资源的操作并非写入线性一致的存储，那怎么办？每个 Redlock 都关联一个“大随机令牌”（生成方式使得碰撞可忽略，规范文本建议“/dev/urandom 的 20 字节”）。有了唯一令牌能做什么？例如实现 Check-and-Set：开始操作共享资源时，把其状态设为“”，只有当写入时令牌仍相同，才执行读-改-写。\nNote that in certain use cases, one could say, it’s useful anyway to have ordered tokens. While it’s hard to think at an use case, note that for the same GC pauses Martin mentions, the order in which the token was acquired, does not necessarily respects the order in which the clients will attempt to work on the shared resource, so the lock order may not be casually related to the effects of working to a shared resource.\n4）在某些用例里，有人或许认为“令牌有序”是有用的。但这并不好举例。注意 Martin 提到的 GC 暂停：令牌获取的顺序，不一定等同于客户端尝试操作共享资源的顺序，因此“加锁顺序”未必与实际操作的效果相关。\nMost of the times, locks are used to access resources that are updated in a way that is non transactional. Sometimes we use distributed locks to move physical objects, for example. Or to interact with another external API, and so forth.\n5）多数时候，锁用于访问以非事务性方式更新的资源。比如用分布式锁搬运物理对象，或与外部 API 交互，等等。\nI want to mention again that, what is strange about all this, is that it is assumed that you always must have a way to handle the fact that mutual exclusion is violated. Actually if you have such a system to avoid problems during race conditions, you probably don’t need a distributed lock at all, or at least you don’t need a lock with strong guarantees, but just a weak lock to avoid, most of the times, concurrent accesses for performances reasons.\n我想再次强调，这里奇怪的地方在于：假设你总能在互斥被破坏时处理后果。如果你真的有这种系统去避免竞争中的问题，你可能根本不需要分布式锁，或者至少不需要“强保证”的锁，只需一个“弱锁”来在多数情况下减少并发访问以提升性能。\nHowever even if you happen to agree with Martin about the fact the above is very useful, the bottom line is that a unique identifier for each lock can be used for the same goals, but is much more practical in terms of not requiring strong guarantees from the store.\n即便你赞同 Martin 的观点，认为上述机制很有用，结论仍是：为每次加锁分配唯一标识也能达到同样目的，并且更务实——不需要存储层提供强保证。\nLet’s talk about system models\n聊聊系统模型\nThe above criticism is basically common to everything which is a distributed lock with auto release, not providing a monotonically increasing counter with each lock. However the other critique of Martin is specific to Redlock. Here Martin really analyzes the algorithm, concluding it is broken.\n上述批评基本上适用于所有“带自动释放、且不提供递增计数器”的分布式锁。不过 Martin 的另一项批评则是针对 Redlock 的：他认真分析了算法，结论是算法有问题。\nRedlock assumes a semi synchronous system model where different processes can count time at more or less the same “speed”. The different processes don’t need in any way to have a bound error in the absolute time. What they need to do is just, for example, to be able to count 5 seconds with a maximum of 10% error. So one counts actual 4.5 seconds, another 5.5 seconds, and we are fine.\nRedlock 假设的是“半同步”系统模型：不同进程的计时速度大致相同。它不要求各进程在绝对时间上有界误差，只需要例如计 5 秒时最大误差 10%。因此一个进程实际计 4.5 秒，另一个计 5.5 秒，也没问题。\nMartin also states that Redlock requires bound messages maximum delays, which is not correct as far as I can tell (I’ll explain later what’s the problem with his reasoning).\nMartin 还声称 Redlock 需要有界的消息最大延迟——据我所知这不正确（后文将解释他的推理问题）。\nSo let’s start with the issue of different processes being unable to count time at the same rate.\n我们先讨论“不同进程无法以相同速率计时”的问题。\nMartin says that the clock can randomly jump in a system because of two issues:\nMartin 认为系统时钟可能因两种原因随机跳变：\nThe system administrator manually alters the clock.\n1）系统管理员手动修改了时钟。\nThe ntpd daemon changes the clock a lot because it receives an update.\n2）ntpd 守护进程收到更新后大幅调整时钟。\nThe above two problems can be avoided by “1” not doing this (otherwise even corrupting a Raft log with “echo foo &gt; /my/raft/log.bin” is a problem), and “2” using an ntpd that does not change the time by jumping directly, but by distributing the change over the course of a larger time span.\n上述两类问题可以避免：第一，别这么做（否则你甚至可以用“echo foo &gt; /my/raft/log.bin”破坏 Raft 日志）；第二，使用不会直接跳变时间、而是把校正分布到较长时间段的 ntpd。\nHowever I think Martin is right that Redis and Redlock implementations should switch to the monotonic time API provided by most operating systems in order to make the above issues less of a problem. This was proposed several times in the past, adds a bit of complexity inside Redis, but is a good idea: I’ll implement this in the next weeks. However while we’ll switch to monotonic time API, because there are advantages, processes running in an operating system without a software (time server) or human (system administrator) elements altering the clock, can count relative time with a bound error even with gettimeofday().\n不过，我同意 Martin 的一点：Redis 与 Redlock 的实现应使用多数操作系统提供的“单调时间 API”，以降低上述问题的影响。过去也有多次提议，这会给 Redis 增加一些复杂度，但这是好主意——我会在接下来几周内实现它。同时，即便使用 gettimeofday()，在没有时间服务器或管理员改动时钟的条件下，进程也能在有界误差内计量相对时间。\nNote that there are past attempts to implement distributed systems even assuming a bound absolute time error (by using GPS units). Redlock does not require anything like that, just the ability of different processes to count 10 seconds as 9.5 or 11.2 (+/- 2 seconds max in the example), for instance.\n需要注意，过去也有系统尝试在假设“绝对时间误差有界”（通过 GPS 单元）的条件下实现分布式。Redlock 不需要这些，只要求不同进程能把 10 秒计为 9.5 或 11.2（例如最大 ±2 秒）。\nSo is Redlock safe or not? It depends on the above. Let’s assume we use the monotonically increasing time API, for the sake of simplicity to rule out implementation details (system administrators with a love for POKE and time servers). Can a process count relative time with a fixed percentage of maximum error? I think this is a sounding YES, and is simpler to reply yes to this than to: “can a process write a log without corrupting it”?\n那么 Redlock 安不安全？取决于上述条件。我们假设使用单调时间 API（为简化，排除管理员手动改时与时间服务器等实现细节）。进程能否以固定比例的最大误差来计量相对时间？我认为答案是明确的“可以”。要回答这个问题，比“一个进程能否在不破坏日志的情况下写日志？”还要简单。\nNetwork delays &amp; co\n网络延迟与其它因素\nMartin says that Redlock does not just depend on the fact that processes can count time at approximately the same time, he says:\nMartin 认为 Redlock 不仅依赖“进程能以近似相同的速度计时”，他说：\n“However, Redlock is not like this. Its safety depends on a lot of timing assumptions: it assumes that all Redis nodes hold keys for approximately the right length of time before expiring; that the network delay is small compared to the expiry duration; and that process pauses are much shorter than the expiry duration.”\n“然而，Redlock 并非如此。它的安全性依赖于很多时间方面的假设：假设所有 Redis 节点在过期前持有键的时间长度大致正确；网络延迟相对于过期时间来说很小；进程暂停远短于过期时间。”\nSo let’s split the above claims into different parts:\n我们把上述主张拆分为三部分：\nRedis nodes hold keys for approximately the right length of time.\n1）Redis 节点持有键的时间长度大致正确。\nNetwork delays are small compared to the expiry duration.\n2）网络延迟相对于过期时间来说较小。\nProcess pauses are much shorter than the expiry duration.\n3）进程暂停远短于过期时间。\nAll the time Martin says that “the system clock jumps” I assume that we covered this by not poking with the system time in a way that is a problem for the algorithm, or for the sake of simplicity by using the monotonic time API. So:\n对于 Martin 提到的“系统时钟跳变”，我假设我们已经通过不随意操作系统时间、或使用单调时间 API 来排除这种问题。那么：\nAbout claim 1: This is not an issue, we assumed that we can count time approximately at the same speed, unless there is any actual argument against it.\n关于第 1 点：这不是问题。我们假设进程能以近似相同的速度计时，除非有反例证明。\nAbout claim 2: Things are a bit more complex. Martin says:\n关于第 2 点：情况更复杂。Martin 说：\n“Okay, so maybe you think that a clock jump is unrealistic, because you’re very confident in having correctly configured NTP to only ever slew the clock.” (Yep we agree here ;-) he continues and says…)\n“好吧，你也许认为时钟跳变不现实，因为你很有信心正确配置了 NTP，只会以平滑方式调整时钟。”（这点我们一致 ;-) 他接着说……）\n“In that case, let’s look at an example of how a process pause may cause the algorithm to fail:\nClient 1 requests lock on nodes A, B, C, D, E.\nWhile the responses to client 1 are in flight, client 1 goes into stop-the-world GC.\nLocks expire on all Redis nodes.\nClient 2 acquires lock on nodes A, B, C, D, E.\nClient 1 finishes GC, and receives the responses from Redis nodes indicating that it successfully acquired the lock (they were held in client 1’s kernel network buffers while the process was paused).\nClients 1 and 2 now both believe they hold the lock.”\n“在这种情况下，我们看一个因进程暂停而导致算法失败的例子：\n客户端 1 向 A、B、C、D、E 节点请求加锁；\n在响应返回途中，客户端 1 进入 Stop-The-World 的 GC；\n所有 Redis 节点上的锁过期；\n客户端 2 在 A、B、C、D、E 节点获取了锁；\n客户端 1 GC 结束，收到来自 Redis 的响应，显示其成功拿到锁（响应在进程暂停期间被保存在客户端 1 的内核网络缓冲里）；\n此时客户端 1 和客户端 2 都认为自己持有锁。”\nIf you read the Redlock specification, that I hadn’t touched for months, you can see the steps to acquire the lock are:\n如果你阅读 Redlock 规范（我几个月没改过），你会看到获取锁的步骤如下：\nGet the current time.\n1）获取当前时间。\n… All the steps needed to acquire the lock …\n2）……执行加锁所需的所有步骤……\nGet the current time, again.\n3）再次获取当前时间。\nCheck if we are already out of time, or if we acquired the lock fast enough.\n4）检查是否已经超时，或者加锁是否足够快。\nDo some work with your lock.\n5）持锁进行操作。\nNote steps 1 and 3. Whatever delay happens in the network or in the processes involved, after acquiring the majority we check again that we are not out of time. The delay can only happen after steps 3, resulting into the lock to be considered ok while actually expired, that is, we are back at the first problem Martin identified of distributed locks where the client fails to stop working to the shared resource before the lock validity expires. Let me tell again how this problem is common with all the distributed locks implementations, and how the token as a solution is both unrealistic and can be used with Redlock as well.\n注意步骤 1 和 3。无论网络或进程发生了何种延迟，在拿到多数派后我们会再次检查是否未超时。只有在步骤 3 之后的延迟，才会导致“锁被认为有效但实际已过期”——也就是回到 Martin 指出的分布式锁常见问题：客户端没能在锁有效期结束前停止对共享资源的操作。再强调一次，这个问题在所有分布式锁实现中都很常见；而令牌方案既不现实，也同样可以在 Redlock 中使用。\nNote that whatever happens between 1 and 3, you can add the network delays you want, the lock will always be considered not valid if too much time elapsed, so Redlock looks completely immune from messages that have unbound delays between processes. It was designed with this goal in mind, and I cannot see how the above race condition could happen.\n需要注意的是，无论在步骤 1 到 3 之间发生了什么，你可以加入任何网络延迟，只要耗时过多，锁都会被判定为无效。因此 Redlock 看起来对“跨进程的无界消息延迟”是免疫的。它就是带着这个目标设计的，我不认为上述竞态会发生。\nYet Martin’s blog post was also reviewed by multiple DS experts, so I’m not sure if I’m missing something here or simply the way Redlock works was overlooked simultaneously by many. I’ll be happy to receive some clarification about this.\n不过，Martin 的博客也被多位分布式系统专家审阅过，所以我不确定是不是我漏掉了什么，或者只是 Redlock 的工作方式被大家同时忽视了。我很乐意收到关于这点的澄清。\nThe above also addresses “process pauses” concern number 3. Pauses during the process of acquiring the lock don’t have effects on the algorithm’s correctness. They can however, affect the ability of a client to make work within the specified lock time to live, as with any other distributed lock with auto release, as already covered above.\n上述讨论也回应了第 3 点“进程暂停”的担忧：在加锁过程中的暂停不会影响算法正确性。但它会影响客户端在锁的存活时间内完成工作的能力——这与任何“自动释放”的分布式锁一样，前文已说明。\nDigression about network delays\n关于网络延迟的插曲\nJust a quick note. In server-side implementations of a distributed lock with auto-release, the client may ask to acquire a lock, the server may allow the client to do so, but the process can stop into a GC pause or the network may be slow or whatever, so the client may receive the “OK, the lock is your” too late, when the lock is already expired. However you can do a lot to avoid your process sleeping for a long time, and you can’t do much to avoid network delays, so the steps to check the time before/after the lock is acquired, to see how much time is left, should actually be common practice even when using other systems implementing locks with an expiry.\n补充一点：在服务端实现的“自动释放”分布式锁中，客户端请求加锁，服务端也允许，但进程可能因 GC 或网络缓慢而暂停，导致客户端收到“OK，锁是你的”时，锁其实已过期。你能做很多事来避免进程长时间休眠，但对网络延迟却无能为力。因此，即便使用其它带过期的锁系统，也应在加锁前后检查时间，确认剩余可用时间——这应成为通用实践。\nFsync or not?\n是否需要 fsync？\nAt some point Martin talks about the fact that Redlock uses delayed restarts of nodes. This requires, again, the ability to be able to wait more or less a specified amount of time, as covered above. Useless to repeat the same things again.\nMartin 在文中提到：Redlock 使用“延迟重启节点”。这再一次要求“能以大致正确的长度等待指定时间”，与上文相同。不再赘述。\nHowever what is important about this is that, this step is optional. You could configure each Redis node to fsync at every operation, so that when the client receives the reply, it knows the lock was already persisted on disk. This is how most other systems providing strong guarantees work. The very interesting thing about Redlock is that you can opt-out any disk involvement at all by implementing delayed restarts. This means it’s possible to process hundreds of thousands locks per second with a few Redis instances, which is something impossible to obtain with other systems.\n但关键在于：该步骤是可选的。你可以配置每个 Redis 节点在每次操作时都 fsync，这样客户端收到响应时就知道锁已经持久化到磁盘了——多数提供强保证的系统都是这么做的。Redlock 的有趣之处在于：你可以通过“延迟重启”来完全避免磁盘参与。这意味着，用少量 Redis 实例每秒可处理数十万次加锁——这在其它系统中几乎不可实现。\nGPS units versus the local computer clock\nGPS 单元 vs 本地计算机时钟\nReturning to the system model, one thing that makes Redlock system model practical is that you can assume a process to never be partitioned with the system clock. Note that this is different compared to other semi synchronous models where GPS units are used, because there are two non obvious partitions that may happen in this case:\n回到系统模型，使 Redlock 模型更实用的一点是：你可以假设进程不会与系统时钟发生“分区”。这与采用 GPS 单元的其它半同步模型不同，因为在那种情况下有两个不明显的“分区”可能发生：\nThe GPS is partitioned away from the GPS network, so it can’t acquire a fix.\n1）GPS 与 GPS 网络分区，无法获得定位。\nThe process and the GPS are not able to exchange messages or there are delays in the messages exchanged.\n2）进程与 GPS 之间无法交换消息，或消息存在延迟。\nThe above problems may result into a liveness or safety violation depending on how the system is orchestrated (safety issues only happen if there is a design error, for example if the GPS updates the system time asynchronously so that, when the GPS does not work, the absolute time error may go over the maximum bound).\n上述问题可能导致活性或安全性违规，取决于系统编排方式（安全性问题仅在设计错误时发生，例如 GPS 异步更新系统时间，导致 GPS 不工作时绝对时间误差超出最大边界）。\nThe Redlock system model does not have these complexities nor requires additional hardware, just the computer clock, and even a very cheap clock with all the obvious biases due to the crystal temperature and other things influencing the precision.\nRedlock 的系统模型没有这些复杂性，也不需要额外硬件，只依赖计算机时钟——即便是非常廉价、受晶体温度等因素影响精度的时钟也可以。\nConclusions\n结论\nI think Martin has a point about the monotonic API, Redis and Redlock implementations should use it to avoid issues due to the system clock being altered. However I can’t identify other points of the analysis affecting Redlock safety, as explained above, nor do I find his final conclusions that people should not use Redlock when the mutual exclusion guarantee is needed, justified.\n我认同 Martin 关于“单调时间 API”的观点：Redis 与 Redlock 的实现应该使用它，以避免系统时钟被修改带来的问题。但除了这点之外，我没有发现文章中其它能影响 Redlock 安全性的论点；也不认同他最终的结论——当需要互斥保证时，人们不应使用 Redlock。\nIt would be great to both receive more feedbacks from experts and to test the algorithm with Jepsen, or similar tools, to accumulate more data.\n如果能收到更多专家反馈，并用 Jepsen 或类似工具测试该算法以积累更多数据，那就更好了。\nA big thank you to the friends of mine that helped me to review this post.\n非常感谢帮助我审阅这篇文章的朋友们。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/is-redlock-safe/","title":"Is Redlock safe?"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/jooq-tuesdays-brett-wooldridge-shows-what-it-takes-to-write-the-fastest-java-connection-pool/":{"body":"原文地址 blog.jooq.org\nWelcome to the jOOQ Tuesdays series.

In this series, we’ll publish an article on the third Tuesday every other month where we interview someone we find exciting in our industry from a jOOQ perspective. This includes people who work with SQL, Java, Open Source, and a variety of other related topics.\n核心观点：\nSimplicity is prerequisite for reliability. - Edsger Dijkstra\nPerfection is Achieved Not When There Is Nothing More to Add, But When There Is Nothing Left to Take Away.\nI’m very excited to feature today Brett Wooldridge, creator of HikariCP, the fastest connection pool available for Java.\nBrett, you’ve created one of the most popular connection pools for Java: HikariCP. What made your library so popular?\nI’ll provide some backstory on HikariCP before I answer that, but I’ll tease the answer by saying “marketing“.\nA few years ago I was creating a product prototype for the company I work for, and I needed a connection pool. Like most developers I just wanted to drop in a pool and move on, so I took to the web to find the most popular and actively maintained library. Unfortunately, while load testing the prototype we started encountering deadlocks, and exceptions indicating connection state bleed over between threads.\nBecause the pool was open source, I thought I’d just pull down the code, find and fix the problems, and contribute back. But when I opened the code, I found thousands of lines more code than I was expecting. &nbsp;Added to the mix were many locks, nested, sometimes acquired in one method and released in some distant place. There was simply no way to reason about where potential deadlocks lurked, even if we found and fixed the ones we encountered.\nI picked up another pool and inspected its code. The lock semantics were clearer, but the volume of code was still more than 2x what I expected, especially given that it was delegating the core pooling logic to a separate library.\nIn addition, all of the pools I studied violated JDBC contracts in multiple ways. In as much as it is possible, a pool should return a Connection that is indistinguishable from one received in the absence of the pool. But these pools didn’t automatically close Statements when a connection was “closed” (returned), or clear warnings, or rollback uncommitted transactions, and they didn’t reset properties altered by the user such as auto-commit or transaction isolation level, and more; resulting in the next consumer getting a “dirty” connection.\nI thought, “Really? This is the state of connection pools in the ecosystem after 20 years of Java?” Out of necessity and frustration, I created HikariCP.\nTo be fair, since I started HikariCP some pools have made some of these “correctness” behaviors configurable, but none of them do so by default and I suspect most users are running with the safety off. &nbsp;At least two popular pools fail to complete our benchmark with OutOfMemory exceptions when they are enabled. &nbsp;Conversely, HikariCP doesn’t support an unsafe mode of operation.\nReturning to your question, as noted above there were many established pools available, so how did HikariCP become popular? &nbsp;“Correctness” and reliability are a tough sell, so I focused on promoting performance, and started with a simple tweet. One follower led to another. &nbsp;Some users tweeted about big performance gains, and improved reliability, and at some point in 2015 the Wix engineering team wrote a blog about switching to HikariCP.\nIn essence, simple word of mouth has led to HikariCP’s rising popularity, with an initial “marketing” push based on performance. &nbsp;I do hope that over time more users will give equal weight to correctness and reliability, without which performance is meaningless, and for my part I plan to write more about those aspects of HikariCP. &nbsp;\nYou quoted Edsger Dijkstra: “Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.” – That reminds me of Antoine de Saint-Exupery’s “Perfection is Achieved Not When There Is Nothing More to Add, But When There Is Nothing Left to Take Away”. How do you manage to keep things simple when this world only ever gets more complicated?\nResisting complexity through feature-creep can be challenging. &nbsp;I get a lot of requests for this or that feature, and while each may be simple in and of itself, if taken in totality would significantly increase complexity and code size. &nbsp;Of course, that is not to say that I don’t add features.\nFor example, initial versions of HikariCP only supported a fixed size pool. &nbsp;HikariCP was designed for systems with fairly constant load, and in that environment pools tend to stay at their maximum size, so I saw little need to complicate the code to support dynamic sizing. &nbsp;Can you imagine a server at Google falling idle for several minutes? &nbsp;Additionally, I feel like the more axes of configuration there are, the more difficult it is for users to optimally configure a pool. &nbsp;However, eventually there were enough users who needed dynamic sizing, and its absence was a barrier to adoption, so support was added. &nbsp;Principally, I did not want lack of dynamic sizing support to deprive users of the reliability and correctness benefits of HikariCP.\nStill, I probably reject the vast majority of feature requests. As the custodian of HikariCP keeping it simple and true to that core philosophy is in the best interest of the community. &nbsp;I always try to minimize the “surface area”, both in terms of code and configuration. &nbsp;The larger the surface area of an API, the more difficult it is to comprehend. &nbsp;Our brains have a limit for the amount of contextual information that can be held “in view” at one time; this is true in a lot of contexts. &nbsp;For example, when reading code, methods larger than a certain size, or conditionals of more than a certain number of terms, are difficult to follow or reason about. &nbsp;Generally, for users of HikariCP, the “surface area” is manifest in the number of configuration parameters. &nbsp;While I can hardly say that “Perfection [has been] achieved”, I do feel like there is not much left to take away without cutting into functionality.\nFew libraries go to the byte code level to optimise their code. While this helps in benchmarks, did it also help your users in production? What were the biggest caveats you found while micro-optimising?\nDefinitely. &nbsp;Maybe some developers are dismissive of the potential gains, because in their minds they think, “What does it matter if connection acquisition takes 100ns or 100μs, the query is going to take 10ms anyway?” &nbsp;However, pools intercept dozens of methods, and the “close()” path is typically slower than acquisition, so it’s not that simple. &nbsp;I often get reports from users providing confirmation of real world performance improvements. &nbsp;It’s anecdotal but one user initially commented in a bug report, “We’re testing HikariCP at the client and have had great initial success – an application loading 1 million records over multiple HTTP threads and putting them in the DB had its run time cut by 70% after moving from Tomcat CP to HikariCP!” &nbsp;The follow-up comment on the bug was, “This was a bug in our side, using some unrelated non-threadsafe code. &nbsp;No issue. &nbsp;After fixing the bug, the code runs about 2x faster using HikariCP than Tomcat CP.” &nbsp;That’s pretty good; and yet some reports surprise even me.\nRegarding optimisation, and as long as we’re quoting famous thinkers, I would be remiss if I didn’t cite Knuth: “We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimisation is the root of all evil.” &nbsp;I think the key word here is “premature”. &nbsp;It is definitely better to write the code as it naturally comes and then, based on detailed profiling and benchmarking, perform “peephole optimisations” (to hijack a word from compiler theory). &nbsp;At the same time, I would estimate that half of the performance gains in HikariCP have come as the result of algorithmic changes, rather than low-level optimisations.\nRegarding caveats to micro-optimising, it would be hard to convey how much I have learned, and am still learning. &nbsp;I’d like to give a shout-out to Aleksey Shipilëv for his excellent JMH micro-benchmark framework. &nbsp;Aleksey has become somewhat of a JVM performance oracle (no pun intended, he used to work for Oracle). &nbsp;The JVM performs an amazing array of optimisations, and if one is not careful then what appears to be a clever optimisation in the code simply confuses the JIT’s pattern-based optimiser and the result is slower rather than faster.\nIn order to effectively optimise on the JVM you sometimes end up reading the JIT source code, and you must become familiar with concepts such as dead code elimination, loop invariant hoisting, constant propagation, virtual call inlining, and many more. &nbsp;Even with a good grip on these concepts I am sometimes surprised by the JVM in my attempts at optimisation. &nbsp;In addition to the JIT, you really must understand the Java Memory Model (JMM) and how it maps onto CPU architectures like x86.\nLastly, after the design of algorithms, contention for shared state is the source of most bottlenecks (see the aforementioned JMM), so recently the biggest gains (for example, in v2.6.0) have come from tricks that simply avoid it; the fastest code is code that is never executed.\nIf there is a main takeaway, it is “trust the benchmarks”, your assumptions and intuitions are wrong more often than you imagine.\nYour fellow jOOQ Tuesdays interviewee Vlad Mihalcea talked to us about queueing theory. How does this compare to what you wrote about connection pool sizing?\nI have great respect for Vlad, I think we’re both members of the Mutual Admiration Society. &nbsp;His FlexyPool is trying to solve a difficult problem; that being how to automatically tune optimal pool settings for varying loads. &nbsp;Ultimately, the upper-bound is constrained by the database’s optimal concurrent query capacity, which is where my write-up on pool sizing comes into play. &nbsp;However, there is a large amount of configuration space in-between a minimally sized pool and that upper-bound, which is where FlexyPool is trying to add value, by ensuring that the pool is “right sized”, dynamically, for the load it is servicing.\nI say it is a difficult problem, because connection pools on modern multi-core servers likely present as a M/G/k queue in queueing theory; arrivals have a Markovian distribution, service times have a General distribution, and there are k servers (where “server” is defined as an abstract single-threaded processor). &nbsp;Quoting wikipedia, “Most performance metrics for this queueing system are not known and remain an open problem.” &nbsp;Modeling connection pools as a M/M/c queue might provide a decent approximation for the purposes of predicting queue lengths, but service times are not likely to have a Markovian distribution. &nbsp;Of course, there are also non-Markovian stochastic models in queueing theory that could be applied. &nbsp;Complicating everything is the fact that queued waiters (threads) can abandon the queue before service, for example when a timeout is reached. &nbsp;That adds an additional twist when trying to predict queue lengths and wait times. &nbsp;Hats off to Vlad for taking on this problem!\nAnyway, what I wrote about setting the upper-bound on pool sizing translates to pinning the k (or c) value in those respective Markovian queueing theory models.\nYou chose a Japanese word in your product: 光 (Hikari, “Light”). What’s your connection to Japan?\nI’ve lived and worked in Tokyo since 2008, though I think my Japanese is far behind where it should be given my time here. &nbsp;I chalk that up to preferring time at the keyboard to language study.\nAs you mentioned, Hikari (pronounced Hi-ka-lee) translates to “Light” (as in sunlight). &nbsp;In English, it is a double entendre in the context of HikariCP; though in Japanese it would not be. &nbsp;“Light” in the sense of “the speed of…”, and “light” in the sense of being light in terms of code weight.","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/jooq-tuesdays-brett-wooldridge-shows-what-it-takes-to-write-the-fastest-java-connection-pool/","title":"Getting Started with Traveling Ultralight"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/why-hikaricp/":{"body":"原文连接\nSimplicity is prerequisite for reliability.\nPerfection is Achieved Not When There Is Nothing More to Add, But When There Is Nothing Left to Take Away.\n本文只是做一下简单的翻译和讲解；\nThis is where we give away the recipe to the secret sauce. When you come in with benchmarks like ours there is a certain amount of skepticism that must be addressed. If you think of performance, and of connection pools, you might be tempted into thinking that the&nbsp;pool&nbsp;is the most important part of the performance equation. Not so clearly so. The number of&nbsp;getConnection()&nbsp;operations in comparison to other JDBC operations is small. A large amount of performance gains come in the optimization of the “delegates” that wrap&nbsp;Connection,&nbsp;Statement, etc.\n本文讲解一下该项目的底层实现原理。当你看到该项目的基准测试结果，如果你心中有疑虑，我们必须给你解释清楚。如果考虑到性能和连接池，你可能会认为连接池是性能中最重要的影响因素。但是并不是如此。与其他JDBC操作相比，getConnection()操作的数量非常少。大量的性能优化是在对\nConnection、Statement 等的包装和委托。\n🧠 We’re in your bytecodez\nIn order to make HikariCP as fast as it is, we went down to bytecode-level engineering, and beyond. We pulled out every trick we know to help the JIT help you. We studied the bytecode output of the compiler, and even the assembly output of the JIT to limit key routines to less than the JIT inline-threshold. We flattened inheritance hierarchies, shadowed member variables, eliminated casts.\n为了使 HikariCP 尽可能快，我们深入研究了字节码级工程，以及更多内容。我们使出浑身解数来帮助 JIT 帮助你。我们研究了编译器的字节码输出，甚至JIT的汇编输出，以将关键例程限制在小于JIT内联阈值的范围内。我们平化了继承层次结构，隐藏了成员变量，消除了强制类型转换。\n🔬 Micro-optimizations\nHikariCP contains many micro-optimizations that individually are barely measurable, but together combine as a boost to overall performance. Some of these optimizations are measured in fractions of a millisecond amortized over millions of invocations.\nHikariCP 包含许多微观优化，这些优化单独来说几乎无法衡量，但是结合在一起可以提高整体性能。其中一些优化是以毫秒级的，只有在数百万次调用中才能体现优化结果。\nArrayList\nOne non-trivial (performance-wise) optimization was eliminating the use of an&nbsp;ArrayList&lt;Statement&gt;&nbsp;instance in the&nbsp;ConnectionProxy&nbsp;used to track open&nbsp;Statement&nbsp;instances. When a&nbsp;Statement&nbsp;is closed, it must be removed from this collection, and when the&nbsp;Connection&nbsp;is closed it must iterate the collection and close any open&nbsp;Statement&nbsp;instances, and finally must clear the collection. The Java&nbsp;ArrayList, wisely for general purpose use, performs a&nbsp;range check&nbsp;upon every&nbsp;get(int index)&nbsp;call. However, because we can provide guarantees about our ranges, this check is merely overhead.\n一个重要的(性能方面的)优化是在 ConnectionProxy 中取消使用 ArrayList 实例来跟踪 open Statement 实例。Statement关闭时，必须从集合中删除该Statement，关闭 Connection 时，必须迭代该集合并关闭任何打开的 Statement 实例，最后必须清理集合。Java ArrayList 为了适用于大多数场景，对每个 get(int index) 调用进行索引检查。但是，因为我们可以提供对索引的范围的保证，所以这个检查只是开销。\nAdditionally, the&nbsp;remove(Object)&nbsp;implementation performs a scan from head to tail, however common patterns in JDBC programming are to close&nbsp;Statements&nbsp;immediately after use, or in reverse order of opening. For these cases, a scan that starts at the tail will perform better. Therefore,&nbsp;ArrayList&lt;Statement&gt;&nbsp;was replaced with a custom class&nbsp;FastList&nbsp;which eliminates range checking and performs removal scans from tail to head.\n此外，remove(Object) 会从头到尾的扫描列表元素，但是 JDBC 编程中的常见模式是在使用语句后立即关闭 Statements，或者以相反的打开顺序关闭Statements。对于这些情况，从尾部开始的扫描将执行得更好。因此，ArrayList&lt;Statement&gt; 被替换为一个自定义类 FastList，它消除了范围检查并执行从尾部到头部的删除扫描。\nConcurrentBag\nHikariCP contains a custom lock-free collection called a&nbsp;ConcurrentBag. The idea was borrowed from the C# .NET ConcurrentBag class, but the internal implementation quite different. The&nbsp;ConcurrentBag&nbsp;provides…\nHikariCP 包含一个称为 ConcurrentBag 的自定义无锁集合。这个想法是从 C# 中借用的。NET ConcurrentBag 类，但内部实现有很大的不同。ConcurrentBag 支持以下特性：\nA lock-free design 无锁设计\nThreadLocal caching ThreadLocal缓存\nQueue-stealing 队列窃取\nDirect hand-off optimizations 直接切换优化\n…resulting in a high degree of concurrency, extremely low latency, and minimized occurrences of&nbsp;false-sharing\n支持高度的并发性，极低的延迟，最小化了 False sharing 的发生。\n上图中thread0位于core0，而thread1位于core1，二者均想更新彼此独立的两个变量，但是由于两个变量位于同一个cache line中，此时可知的是两个cache line的状态应该都是Shared，而对于cache line的操作core间必须争夺主导权（ownership），如果core0抢到了，thread0因此去更新cache line，会导致core1中的cache line状态变为Invalid，随后thread1去更新时必须通知core0将cache line刷回主存，然后它再从主从中load该cache line进高速缓存之后再进行修改，但令人抓狂的是，该修改又会使得core0的cache line失效，重复上演历史，从而高速缓存并未起到应有的作用，反而影响了性能。\nInvocation:&nbsp;invokevirtual&nbsp;vs&nbsp;invokestatic\nIn order to generate proxies for&nbsp;Connection,&nbsp;Statement, and&nbsp;ResultSet&nbsp;instances HikariCP was initially using a singleton factory, held in the case of&nbsp;ConnectionProxy&nbsp;in a&nbsp;static&nbsp;field (PROXY_FACTORY).\n为了给 Connection，Statement 和 ResultSet 实例生成代理，HikariCP 最初使用了一个单例工厂，例如 ConnectionProxy ，保存在一个静态字段(PROXY_FACTORY)中。\nThere was a dozen or so methods resembling the following:\n有十几种类似的方法:\nUsing the original singleton factory, the generated bytecode looked like this:\n使用最初的单例工厂，生成的字节码如下所示：\nYou can see that first there is a&nbsp;getstatic&nbsp;call to get the value of the static field&nbsp;PROXY_FACTORY, as well as (lastly) the&nbsp;invokevirtual&nbsp;call to&nbsp;getProxyPreparedStatement()&nbsp;on the&nbsp;ProxyFactory&nbsp;instance.\n可以看到，首先有一个 getstatic 的调用获取静态字段 PROXY_FACTORY 的值，以及（最后）在 ProxyFactory 实例上 invokevirtual 调用指向 getProxyPreparedStatement()。\nWe eliminated the singleton factory (which was generated by Javassist) and replaced it with a final class having&nbsp;static&nbsp;methods (whose&nbsp;bodies&nbsp;are generated by Javassist). The Java code became:\n我们消除了单例工厂(由 Javassist 类库生成) ，替换最后一个有static方法的final类 (方法体由Javassist生成)。\nJava 代码变成:\nWhere&nbsp;getProxyPreparedStatement()&nbsp;is a&nbsp;static&nbsp;method defined in the&nbsp;ProxyFactory&nbsp;class. The resulting bytecode is:\n其中 getProxyPreparedStatement() 是在 ProxyFactory 类中定义的静态方法:\nThere are three things of note here:\n这里有三件值得注意的事情:\nThe&nbsp;getstatic&nbsp;call is gone. *\n没有getstatic 调用了*\nThe&nbsp;invokevirtual&nbsp;call is replaced with a&nbsp;invokestatic&nbsp;call that is more easily optimized by the JVM.\ninvokevirtual 调用被替换为 invokestatic 调用，invokestatic 容易被JVM优化。\nLastly, possibly not noticed at first glance is that the stack size is reduced from 5 elements to 4 elements. This is because in the case of&nbsp;invokevirtual&nbsp;there is an implicit passing of the instance of ProxyFactory on the stack (i.e&nbsp;this), and there is an additional (unseen)&nbsp;pop&nbsp;of that value from the stack when&nbsp;getProxyPreparedStatement()&nbsp;was called.\n最后，一开始可能没有注意到的是堆栈大小从5个元素减少到4个元素。这是因为在 invokevirtal 的情况下，在堆栈上隐式传递了 ProxyFactory 的实例(即 This) ，并且在调用 getProxyPreparedStatement() 时，从堆栈中有一个额外的(不可见的)弹出值。\nIn all, this change removed a static field access, a push and pop from the stack, and made the invocation easier for the JIT to optimize because the&nbsp;callsite&nbsp;is guaranteed not to change.\n总之，这个更改删除了静态字段访问、栈中的推送和弹出操作，并使 JIT 更容易优化调用，因为减少了隐式转换。\ninvokevirtal 不容易内联\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯&nbsp;Yeah, but still…\nIn our benchmark, we are obviously running against a stub JDBC driver implementation, so the JIT is doing a lot of inlining. However, the same inlining at the stub-level is occurring for other pools in the benchmark. So, no inherent advantage to us.\n我们的基准测试，使用 stub JDBC 驱动，JIT 会做大量的内联优化。同样，使用其他连接池做基准测试时 JIT 产生同样的优化，所以，对我们来说没有先天优势。\nBut inlining is certainly a big part of the equation even when real drivers are in use, which brings us to another topic…\n但是，即使在使用真正的驱动程序时，内联也肯定是很大一部分因素，这就把我们带到了另一个话题…\n参考：what‘s the purpose to generate HikariProxyConnection by javaassist since you already write ProxyConnection ?\nThe proxies delegate to the real driver classes. Some proxies, like the one for ResultSet, only intercept a few methods. Without the code generation, the proxy would have to implement all 50+ methods which simply delegate to the wrapped instance.\nCode generation, based on reflection, also means that nothing needs to be done when a new JDK version introduces new JDBC methods to existing interfaces.\n代理委托给真正的驱动类。有些代理，比如ResultSet的代理，只截取几个方法。如果没有代码生成，代理将不得不实现所有50多个方法，这些方法只是委托给包装的实例。\n基于反射的代码生成还意味着，当新的JDK版本向现有接口引入新的JDBC方法时，不需要做任何事情。\n⏱ Scheduler quanta\nSome&nbsp;light reading.\nTL;DR&nbsp;Obviously, when you’re running 400 threads “at once”, you aren’t really running them “at once” unless you have 400 cores. The operating system, using N CPU cores, switches between your threads giving each a small “slice” of time to run called a&nbsp;quantum.\nWith a lot of threads running, as in many applications, when your time-slice runs out (as a thread) it may be a “long time” before the scheduler gives you a chance to run again. It is therefore crucial that a thread get as much as possible done during its time-slice, and avoid locks that force it to give up that time-slice, otherwise there is a performance penalty to be paid. And not a small one.\nWhich brings us to…\n🐌 CPU Cache-line Invalidation\nAnother big hit incurred when you can’t get your work done in a quanta is CPU cache-line invalidation. If your thread is preempted by the scheduler, when it does get a chance to run again all of the data it&nbsp;was&nbsp;frequently accessing is likely no longer in the core’s L1 or core-pair L2 cache. Even more likely because you have no control over which core you will be scheduled on next.\n在多核处理器上，缓存遇到了一个问题——一致性。不同的处理器拥有完全或部分分离的缓存。L1缓存是分离的（这很普遍），而我有多个处理器，每一个处理器共享一个L2缓存。这随着具体情况而不同，如果一个现代多核机器上拥有多级缓存，那么快速小型的缓存将被处理器独占。\n当一个处理器改变了属于它自己缓存中的一个值，其它处理器就再也无法使用它自己原来的值，因为其对应的内存位置将被刷新(invalidate)到所有缓存。而且由于缓存操作是以缓存行而不是字节为粒度，所有缓存中整个缓存行将被刷新！\n关于 CPU缓存知识 可以参考以下文档：\n与程序员相关的CPU缓存知识\n7个示例科普CPU Cache\n代码执行的效率\n性能调优攻略\n参考文档：\nhttps://www.linqz.io/2019/03/why-to-use-hikari-connection-pool.html\nHow to choose database connection pool :&nbsp;https://techblog.topdesk.com/coding/choosing-a-database-connection-pool/\nhttp://www.programmersought.com/article/319698001/\nHow to size the Pool :&nbsp;https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/About-Pool-Sizing\nDatabase Down Behaviour :&nbsp;https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/Bad-Behavior:-Handling-Database-Down\nPerformance Comparison 1 :&nbsp;https://www.wix.engineering/blog/how-does-hikaricp-compare-to-other-connection-pools\nPerformance Comparison 2 :&nbsp;https://nbsoftsolutions.com/blog/the-difficulty-of-performance-evaluation-of-hikaricp-in-dropwizard\nhttps://blog.jooq.org/2017/02/21/jooq-tuesdays-brett-wooldridge-shows-what-it-takes-to-write-the-fastest-java-connection-pool/","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/why-hikaricp/","title":"HikariCP: Down the Rabbit Hole"},"https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/why-to-use-hikari-connection-pool/":{"body":"原文连接\nHikari&nbsp;Connection Pooling (or Hikari CP) is the new kid on the block, though a late entrant in pooling mechanisms, it is outperforming the ones offered by&nbsp;C3P0,&nbsp;Apache Commons DBCP,&nbsp;BoneCP,&nbsp;Tomcat,&nbsp;Vibur&nbsp;etc.\nBelow benchmark graph displays connection and statement ops/ms graphs:\nsource :&nbsp;GitHub - brettwooldridge/HikariCP\nMultiple Blogs are already written about comparison and performance of&nbsp;HikariCP, so this blog tries to explore some of the internal intricacies for e.g Why it is faster in comparison with its peer connection pooling libraries ?

宣布修改其开源协议，这一举动在开源社区引发了巨大的震动，也直接促成了 Valkey 的诞生。如今一年过去，随着 Redis 8.0 和 Valkey 8.0/8.1 的相继发布，这场“分叉“已经不仅仅是关于许可证的争论，更演变成了两种不同技术理念和架构路线的较量。\n本文将基于最新的技术资料，深入对比这两个项目的现状，帮助开发者在 2025 年做出明智的技术选型。\n1. 核心差异概览：从 DNA 到分道扬镳\nValkey 最初是作为 Redis 7.2.4 的直接 Fork 诞生的，因此它们共享着相同的 DNA：基于内存的键值存储、支持丰富的数据结构、Lua 脚本以及主从复制架构。然而，随着时间的推移，两者在发展方向上展现出了明显的差异。\n特性Redis (8.0+)Valkey (8.0/8.1+)\n许可证RSALv2 / SSPLv1 (非 OSI 认可开源)BSD 3-Clause (完全开源，Linux 基金会托管)\n治理模式商业公司主导 (Redis Inc.)社区驱动 (AWS, Google, Oracle, Snap 等支持)\n核心架构保守改进，集成 Stack 模块激进优化，重构核心 I/O 和内存管理\n生态定位更加封闭的商业生态，强调集成体验坚持开放标准，兼容现有 Redis 生态\n2. 架构与性能：多线程的较量\n线程模型的演进是本次对比的重头戏。长期以来，Redis 的单线程模型既是其简单高效的秘诀，也是其在大核服务器上的性能瓶颈。\nRedis 8.0：稳健的多线程 I/O\nRedis 在 6.0 引入了多线程 I/O，但核心命令执行依然是单线程的。Redis 8.0 进一步优化了这一模型。\n改进点：Redis 8.0 的新 I/O 线程模型允许将更多网络读写和协议解析工作卸载给辅助线程。\n性能表现：在多核 Intel CPU 上，开启 io-threads 后，吞吐量相比旧版本提升了约 112%。但其核心依然受到主线程处理能力的限制。\nValkey 8.0：激进的异步 I/O 架构\nValkey 采取了更为激进的策略。虽然为了保持原子性，命令执行仍为单线程，但 Valkey 8.0 引入了增强型异步 I/O 线程。\n架构革新：Valkey 现在可以并行处理网络读取、解析以及响应写入，同时还能基于实时负载智能地将 I/O 任务分发到多个核心。\n百万级 RPS：Benchmark 显示，在 AWS c7g.4xlarge (16 vCPU) 实例上，Valkey 8.0 达到了惊人的 119 万 RPS (Requests Per Second)，相比 7.2 版本提升了 230%。\n实战反馈：Linux 内核开发者 Dirk Hohndel 报告称，在处理大规模数据流时，Valkey 带来了约 3 倍的性能提升。\n结论：在现代多核服务器上，Valkey 展现出了更高的垂直扩展能力（Scale-up），能够更榨干硬件性能。\n3. 内存效率：每字节都算数\n对于内存数据库而言，内存效率直接等同于金钱。\nValkey 的 Swiss Tables 优化：Valkey 8.1 受 Google Abseil “Swiss Tables” 的启发，彻底重写了底层的哈希表实现。这一改变使得每个键值对的内存开销减少了约 20 字节。\n实际收益：对于包含数亿个小 Key 的大规模数据集，这意味着最高可达 20% 的内存节省。在大规模集群中，这直接转化为显著的成本降低。\nRedis：虽然也有内存驱逐策略的优化，但在核心数据结构的内存紧凑性上，近期未见如此幅度的底层重构。\n4. 可靠性与复制：告别 Fork 风暴\nRedis 的持久化（RDB/AOF）和全量复制一直依赖 fork() 系统调用。在拥有大内存（如 &gt;50GB）的实例上，fork() 不仅耗时，还会通过 Copy-on-Write (COW) 机制消耗大量额外内存，甚至导致性能抖动。\nRedis 8.0 的双流复制：引入了双流机制，一个流传 RDB，另一个流传增量数据，使得同步速度提升了约 18%。\nValkey 的双通道复制：Valkey 同样实现了类似的双通道复制架构。更重要的是，Valkey 针对 fork() 的开销进行了深度优化，在重读场景下的全量同步时间最高减少了 50%，极大缓解了节点故障恢复时的集群压力。\n5. 功能集：大而全 vs 专而精\nRedis 的策略是“开箱即用“的丰富度。Redis 8.0 将之前的 Redis Stack 模块及其功能直接吸收到核心发行版中：\n原生 JSON 支持：无需插件，直接操作 JSON 文档。\n向量搜索 (Vector Search)：面向 AI 应用，支持高维向量相似度搜索。\n时间序列 &amp; 概率数据结构：内置 Bloom Filter 等。\nValkey 则专注于核心数据库的能力，但追赶速度极快：\nJSON 支持：Valkey 8.1 已经引入了 JSON 数据类型支持。\nBloom Filter：同样在 8.1 中加入。\n缺失项：目前 Valkey 在向量搜索（Vector Search）方面尚未原生集成，这对于需要构建 RAG（检索增强生成）应用的开发者来说是一个重要的考量点。\n总结：如何选择？\n2025年的选择逻辑比以往清晰：\n选择 Redis 8.0 如果…\n你需要官方企业级支持和商业合规背书。\n你的应用深度依赖 Redis Stack 的高级功能，特别是 Vector Search 进行 AI 开发。\n你更看重全家桶式的集成体验（如 Redis Insight, Redis Copilot）。\n选择 Valkey 8.1 如果…\n你坚定支持完全开源 (Open Source) 协议，避免许可证风险。\n你的场景是极致的高并发，需要单节点承载百万级 QPS。\n你拥有海量小数据，20% 的内存节省对成本至关重要。\n你希望紧跟 Linux 基金会及 AWS/Google 等大厂主导的开放技术栈。\nValkey 已经证明了它不仅仅是一个“抗议的 Fork“，而是一个在性能和架构上敢于革新的强大竞争者。对于大多数纯缓存和基础 KV 存储场景，Valkey 如今无疑是更具吸引力的选择。","id":"https://scp.net.cn/blog/valkey-vs-redis-technical-comparison/","title":"Redis vs.

负责展示与分析。本指南提炼自项目内部教程并结合官方文档，围绕“抓包设置—过滤配置—分析工作流—实战案例”构建一套可落地的方法论，面向初学者与资深工程师均可读。\n核心功能与 macOS 应用场景\n实时捕获与离线分析：接口选择、滚动抓包、保存为 pcap/pcapng、离线复盘。\n协议深入解析：数百种协议（HTTP/HTTP2、TLS、DNS、TCP/UDP、ARP 等）分层展示与字段级过滤。\n强力过滤：捕获过滤（BPF）减少数据量；显示过滤（Wireshark 语法）精准定位问题流。\n工作流工具：Follow Stream、Expert Information、Conversations/Endpoints、I/O Graph、Statistics 汇总。\nmacOS 特性：以非管理员身份运行 GUI，通过 dumpcap 获取必要权限，减少高权限代码面风险。\n安装与权限配置（macOS）\nHomebrew 安装（推荐）：\nbrew install --cask wireshark\n官网 DMG：\n访问 https://www.wireshark.org/download.html 下载并安装。\nMacPorts：\nsudo port install wireshark\n权限说明（抓包需特权）：\n尽量避免以管理员权限运行完整 GUI；仅让 dumpcap 具备抓包权限。不同安装路径中 dumpcap 位置可能为 /Applications/Wireshark.app/...、/usr/local/bin 或 /opt/homebrew/bin。\n如果无法抓包，可临时使用管理员运行或为 dumpcap 配置权限（谨慎）：\n运行时管理员：sudo wireshark（不推荐，存在安全风险，官方不建议以 root 运行全部代码）\n设置 dumpcap 特权（按官方文档原则，仅赋予抓包最小权限；路径因安装不同而异）\n参考：Wireshark 官方“Capture Privileges”与“Binary Packaging”文档（见文末引用）。\n安全提示：所有需要提升权限的功能集中在 dumpcap，不要让 Wireshark/TShark 以管理员身份常态运行。\n实施示例：抓包设置\n选择接口\n打开 Wireshark，选择有流量的接口（以太网、Wi-Fi、VPN 虚拟接口）。\n验证接口：ifconfig -a 或在界面“Interface List”观察数据速率。\nCapture Options 配置\n缓冲区大小、滚动写入（文件轮换）、是否启用混杂模式。\n可设置捕获过滤器（BPF），示例见下节。\n开始与停止\n点击 Start 开始；工具栏 Stop 或菜单 Capture → Stop 结束。\n保存与回放\nFile → Save As，格式：.pcap/.pcapng。支持 capinfos 查看摘要、editcap 分割合并。\n命令行等价（TShark）：\n过滤器配置技巧\n捕获过滤（BPF，减少采集数据量）：\n显示过滤（Wireshark 语法，捕获后精准定位）：\n分析工作流（效率提升）\nFollow Stream：右键 → Follow → TCP/HTTP Stream，串联完整会话，适合请求/响应核对。\nExpert Information：Analyze → Expert Information，快速定位错误/警告（重传、握手异常、协议违规）。\nStatistics：\nProtocol Hierarchy：各协议占比与层级结构。\nConversations/Endpoints：流会话数量、字节与包统计，定位热点连接与“大流”。\nI/O Graph：随时间的吞吐趋势，观察峰值与抖动。\nColoring Rules：为关键协议/状态着色，提升视觉识别效率。\n时间列与时间基准：View → Time Display Format 选择相对/绝对时间，提高时序分析能力。\n实战案例：从问题到结论\n排查网络连接故障（DNS 与 TCP 握手）\n现象：应用无法访问目标域名或连接超时。\n步骤：\n过滤 dns，检查查询/响应与 Response Code；定位是否 NXDOMAIN/超时。\n若 DNS 正常：过滤 TCP 三次握手 tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0，观察是否无 ACK 或重传。\n查看 tcp.analysis.retransmission 与 tcp.analysis.rtt，判断链路质量。\n结论示例：DNS 解析失败导致连接不可达；或服务器无响应引发握手失败。\n安全事件分析（异常出站与可疑域名）\n现象：主机向未知域名/地址持续连接，或可疑 POST 上传。\n步骤：\n过滤 tls.handshake.extensions_server_name，发现非常规 SNI 或子域名；核对白名单。\n过滤 http.request.method == \"POST\" and http.host contains \"upload\"，检查是否外泄行为。\n汇总出站端点：Statistics → Endpoints，锁定异常目标与端口。\n结论示例：发现指向外部的异常 SNI 连接，需配合日志与威胁情报进一步处置。\n应用性能监控（TCP/HTTP 时延与吞吐）\n现象：页面加载慢或 API 响应抖动。\n步骤：\n使用 tcp.analysis.rtt 评估往返时延，定位高 RTT 会话。\nI/O Graph 观察带宽使用与峰值，识别抖动时段。\nFollow HTTP Stream 分析头部与响应时间，结合 http.time（若提供）与服务器日志。\n结论示例：链路端拥塞导致 RTT 上升；或后端响应慢导致整体耗时增加。\n可视化与示例素材\n界面截图建议：\n主界面（接口列表、过滤器栏、数据包列表、协议树、字节视图）。\nFollow Stream、Expert Information、I/O Graph、Conversations 视图。\n建议将截图置于 static/images/wireshark/，示例路径：/images/wireshark/interface-list.png、/images/wireshark/io-graph.png。\n数据包时序示意（示例，三次握手）：\n进阶技巧与代码片段\n自定义着色规则：View → Coloring Rules，突出 tcp.analysis.retransmission、http.request。\n会话级提取：用 Follow TCP Stream 导出负载；或 TShark 用 -z conv,tcp 输出会话统计。\n常见故障与排除\n无法抓包：检查 dumpcap 权限与接口可见性；尝试管理员运行以验证路径问题。\n接口不可见：在 Wi-Fi/VPN 下确认接口名（en0/en1 等），使用 networksetup -listallhardwareports。\n文件损坏：用 capinfos 检查并用 tshark -r bad.pcapng -w fixed.pcapng 重新导出。\n引用与参考\nWireshark 官方下载与文档：https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
