As coding agents have grown more powerful, a pattern has emerged: you describe your goal, get a block of code back, and often… it looks right, but doesn’t quite work. This “vibe-coding” approach can be great for quick prototypes, but less reliable when building serious, mission-critical applications or working with existing codebases.

Sometimes the code doesn’t compile. Sometimes it solves part of the problem but misses the actual intent. The stack or architecture may not be what you’d choose.

The issue isn’t the coding agent’s coding ability, but our approach. We treat coding agents like search engines when we should be treating them more like literal-minded pair programmers. They excel at pattern recognition but still need unambiguous instructions.

That’s why we’re rethinking specifications — not as static documents, but as living, executable artifacts that evolve with the project. Specs become the shared source of truth. When something doesn’t make sense, you go back to the spec; when a project grows complex, you refine it; when tasks feel too large, you break them down.

Spec Kit, our new open sourced toolkit for spec-driven development, provides a structured process to bring spec-driven development to your coding agent workflows with tools included.
