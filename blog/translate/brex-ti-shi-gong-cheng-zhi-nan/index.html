It does this by assigning a probability to likely next sequences and then samples from those to choose one<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup>. The process repeats until some stopping criteria is met.<p>Large language models learn these probabilities by training on large corpuses of text. A consequence of this is that the models will cater to some use cases better than others (e.g. if it’s trained on GitHub data, it’ll understand the probabilities of sequences in source code really well). Another consequence is that the model may generate statements that seem plausible, but are actually just random without being grounded in reality.<p>As language models become more accurate at predicting sequences, <a href=https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/>many surprising abilities emerge</a>.<div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p>Language models actually use tokens, not words. A token roughly maps to a syllable in a word, or about 4 characters.</div><div class=footnote-definition id=2><sup class=footnote-definition-label>2</sup><p>There are many different pruning and sampling strategies to alter the behavior and performance of the sequences.</div><h3 id=a-brief-incomplete-and-somewhat-incorrect-history-of-language-models>A Brief, Incomplete, and Somewhat Incorrect History of Language Models</h3><blockquote><p>📌 Skip <a href=https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/brex-ti-shi-gong-cheng-zhi-nan/#what-is-a-prompt>to here</a> if you’d like to jump past the history of language models. This section is for the curious minded, though may also help you understand the reasoning behind the advice that follows.</blockquote><h4 id=pre-2000-s>Pre-2000’s</h4><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model#Model_types>Language models</a> have existed for decades, though traditional language models (e.g. <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram_language_model>n-gram models</a>) have many deficiencies in terms of an explosion of state space (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality>the curse of dimensionality</a>) and working with novel phrases that they’ve never seen (sparsity). Plainly, older language models can generate text that vaguely resembles the statistics of human generated text, but there is no consistency within the output – and a reader will quickly realize it’s all gibberish. N-gram models also don’t scale to large values of N, so are inherently limited.<h4 id=mid-2000-s>Mid-2000’s</h4><p>In 2007, Geoffrey Hinton – famous for popularizing backpropagation in 1980’s – <a href=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/tics.pdf>published an important advancement in training neural networks</a> that unlocked much deeper networks. Applying these simple deep neural networks to language modeling helped alleviate some of problems with language models – they represented nuanced arbitrary concepts in a finite space and continuous way, gracefully handling sequences not seen in the training corpus. These simple neural networks learned the probabilities of their training corpus well, but the output would statistically match the training data and generally not be coherent relative to the input sequence.<h4 id=early-2010-s>Early-2010’s</h4><p>Although they were first introduced in 1995, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks</a> found their time to shine in the 2010’s. LSTMs allowed models to process arbitrary length sequences and, importantly, alter their internal state dynamically as they processed the input to remember previous things they saw. This minor tweak led to remarkable improvements. In 2015, Andrej Karpathy <a href=http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/>famously wrote about creating a character-level lstm</a> that performed far better than it had any right to.<p>LSTMs have seemingly magical abilities, but struggle with long term dependencies. If you asked it to complete the sentence, “In France, we traveled around, ate many pastries, drank lots of wine, … lots more text … , but never learned how to speak _______”, the model might struggle with predicting “French”. They also process input one token at a time, so are inherently sequential, slow to train, and the <code>Nth</code> token only knows about the <code>N - 1</code> tokens prior to it.<h4 id=late-2010-s>Late-2010’s</h4><p>In 2017, Google wrote a paper, <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf>Attention Is All You Need</a>, that introduced <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)>Transformer Networks</a> and kicked off a massive revolution in natural language processing. Overnight, machines could suddenly do tasks like translating between languages nearly as good as (sometimes better than) humans. Transformers are highly parallelizable and introduce a mechanism, called “attention”, for the model to efficiently place emphasis on specific parts of the input. Transformers analyze the entire input all at once, in parallel, choosing which parts are most important and influential. Every output token is influenced by every input token.<p>Transformers are highly parallelizable, efficient to train, and produce astounding results. A downside to transformers is that they have a fixed input and output size – the context window – and computation increases quadratically with the size of this window (in some cases, memory does as well!) <sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup>.<p>Transformers are not the end of the road, but the vast majority of recent improvements in natural language processing have involved them. There is still abundant active research on various ways of implementing and applying them, such as <a href=https://www.amazon.science/blog/20b-parameter-alexa-model-sets-new-marks-in-few-shot-learning>Amazon’s AlexaTM 20B</a> which outperforms GPT-3 in a number of tasks and is an order of magnitude smaller in its number of parameters.<div class=footnote-definition id=3><sup class=footnote-definition-label>3</sup><p>There are more recent variations to make these more compute and memory efficient, but remains an active area of research.</div><h4 id=2020-s>2020’s</h4><p>While technically starting in 2018, the theme of the 2020’s has been Generative Pre-Trained models – more famously known as GPT. One year after the “Attention Is All You Need” paper, OpenAI released <a href=https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf>Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training</a>. This paper established that you can train a large language model on a massive set of data without any specific agenda, and then once the model has learned the general aspects of language, you can fine-tune it for specific tasks and quickly get state-of-the-art results.<p>In 2020, OpenAI followed up with their GPT-3 paper <a href=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Paper.pdf>Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</a>, showing that if you scale up GPT-like models by another factor of ~10x, in terms of number of parameters and quantity of training data, you no longer have to fine-tune it for many tasks. The capabilities emerge naturally and you get state-of-the-art results via text interaction with the model.<p>In 2022, OpenAI followed-up on their GPT-3 accomplishments by releasing <a href=https://openai.com/research/instruction-following>InstructGPT</a>. The intent here was to tweak the model to follow instructions, while also being less toxic and biased in its outputs. The key ingredient here was <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</a>, a concept co-authored by Google and OpenAI in 2017<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#4>4</a></sup>, which allows humans to be in the training loop to fine-tune the model output to be more in line with human preferences. InstructGPT is the predecessor to the now famous <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT>ChatGPT</a>.<p>OpenAI has been a major contributor to large language models over the last few years, including the most recent introduction of <a href=https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf>GPT-4</a>, but they are not alone. Meta has introduced many open source large language models like <a href=https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-66b>OPT</a>, <a href=https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-iml-30b>OPT-IML</a> (instruction tuned), and <a href=https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/>LLaMa</a>. Google released models like <a href=https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl>FLAN-T5</a> and <a href=https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased>BERT</a>. And there is a huge open source research community releasing models like <a href=https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom>BLOOM</a> and <a href=https://github.com/stability-AI/stableLM/>StableLM</a>.<p>Progress is now moving so swiftly that every few weeks the state-of-the-art is changing or models that previously required clusters to run now run on Raspberry PIs.<div class=footnote-definition id=4><sup class=footnote-definition-label>4</sup><p>2017 was a big year for natural language processing.</div><h2 id=what-is-a-prompt>What is a prompt?</h2><p>A prompt, sometimes referred to as context, is the text provided to a model before it begins generating output. It guides the model to explore a particular area of what it has learned so that the output is relevant to your goals. As an analogy, if you think of the language model as a source code interpreter, then a prompt is the source code to be interpreted. Somewhat amusingly, a language model will happily attempt to guess what source code will do:<p align=center><img title="The GPT-4 model interpreting Python code." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/231946874-be91d3de-d773-4a6c-a4ea-21043bd5fc13.png width=450><p>And it <em>almost</em> interprets the Python perfectly!<p>Frequently, prompts will be an instruction or a question, like:<p align=center><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232413246-81db18dc-ef5b-4073-9827-77bd0317d031.png width=500><p>On the other hand, if you don’t specify a prompt, the model has no anchor to work from and you’ll see that it just <strong>randomly samples from anything it has ever consumed</strong>:<p><strong>From GPT-3-Davinci:</strong><table><thead><tr><th><img alt=image src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232413846-70b05cd1-31b6-4977-93f0-20bf29af7132.png><th><img alt=image src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232413930-7d414dcd-87e5-431a-91c8-bb6e0ef54f42.png><th><img alt=image src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232413978-59c7f47d-ec20-4673-9458-85471a41fee0.png><tbody></table><p><strong>From GPT-4:</strong><table><thead><tr><th><img alt=image src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232414631-928955e5-3bab-4d57-b1d6-5e56f00ffda1.png><th><img alt=image src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232414678-e5b6d3f4-36c6-420f-b38f-2f9c8df391fb.png><th><img alt=image src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232414734-c8f09cad-aceb-4149-a28a-33675cde8011.png><tbody></table><h3 id=hidden-prompts>Hidden Prompts</h3><blockquote><p>⚠️ Always assume that any content in a hidden prompt can be seen by the user.</blockquote><p>In applications where a user is interacting with a model dynamically, such as chatting with the model, there will typically be portions of the prompt that are never intended to be seen by the user. These hidden portions may occur anywhere, though there is almost always a hidden prompt at the start of a conversation.<p>Typically, this includes an initial chunk of text that sets the tone, model constraints, and goals, along with other dynamic information that is specific to the particular session – user name, location, time of day, etc…<p>The model is static and frozen at a point in time, so if you want it to know current information, like the time or the weather, you must provide it.<p>If you’re using <a href=https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction>the OpenAI Chat API</a>, they delineate hidden prompt content by placing it in the <code>system</code> role.<p>Here’s an example of a hidden prompt followed by interactions with the content in that prompt:<p align=center><img title=" A very simple hidden prompt." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232416074-84ebcc10-2dfc-49e1-9f48-a240102877ee.png width=550><p>In this example, you can see we explain to the bot the various roles, some context on the user, some dynamic data we want the bot to have access to, and then guidance on how the bot should respond.<p>In practice, hidden prompts may be quite large. Here’s a larger prompt taken from a <a href=https://github.com/manno/chatgpt-linux-assistant/blob/main/system_prompt.txt>ChatGPT command-line assistant</a>:<details><summary>From: https://github.com/manno/chatgpt-linux-assistant</summary> <pre><code>We are a in a chatroom with 3 users. 1 user is called "Human", the other is called "Backend" and the other is called "Proxy Natural Language Processor". I will type what "Human" says and what "Backend" replies. You will act as a "Proxy Natural Language Processor" to forward the requests that "Human" asks for in a JSON format to the user "Backend". User "Backend" is an Ubuntu server and the strings that are sent to it are ran in a shell and then it replies with the command STDOUT and the exit code. The Ubuntu server is mine. When "Backend" replies with the STDOUT and exit code, you "Proxy Natural Language Processor" will parse and format that data into a simple English friendly way and send it to "Human". Here is an example:

I ask as human:
Human: How many unedited videos are left?
Then you send a command to the Backend:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Backend {"command":"find ./Videos/Unedited/ -iname '*.mp4' | wc -l"}
Then the backend responds with the command STDOUT and exit code:
Backend: {"STDOUT":"5", "EXITCODE":"0"}
Then you reply to the user:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Human There are 5 unedited videos left.

Only reply what "Proxy Natural Language Processor" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.

Another example:

I ask as human:
Human: What is a PEM certificate?
Then you send a command to the Backend:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Backend {"command":"xdg-open 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail'"}
Then the backend responds with the command STDOUT and exit code:
Backend: {"STDOUT":"", "EXITCODE":"0"}
Then you reply to the user:
Proxy Natural Language Processor: @Human I have opened a link which describes what a PEM certificate is.


Only reply what "Proxy Natural Language Processor" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.

Do NOT REPLY as Backend. DO NOT complete what Backend is supposed to reply. YOU ARE NOT TO COMPLETE what Backend is supposed to reply.
Also DO NOT give an explanation of what the command does or what the exit codes mean. DO NOT EVER, NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, REPLY AS BACKEND.

Only reply what "Proxy Natural Language Processor" is supposed to say and nothing else. Not now nor in the future for any reason.

The atomic unit of consumption for a language model is not a “word”, but rather a “token”. You can kind of think of tokens as syllables, and on average they work out to about 750 words per 1,000 tokens. They represent many concepts beyond just alphabetical characters – such as punctuation, sentence boundaries, and the end of a document.<p>Here’s an example of how GPT may tokenize a sequence:<p align=center><img title="An example tokenization. You can experiment here: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer " src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232417569-8d562792-64b5-423d-a7a2-db7513dd4d61.png width=550><p>You can experiment with a tokenizer here: <a href=https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer>https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer</a><p>Different models will use different tokenizers with different levels of granularity. You could, in theory, just feed a model 0’s and 1’s – but then the model needs to learn the concept of characters from bits, and then the concept of words from characters, and so forth. Similarly, you could feed the model a stream of raw characters, but then the model needs to learn the concept of words, and punctuation, etc… and, in general, the models will perform worse.<p>To learn more, <a href=https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tokenizer_summary>Hugging Face has a wonderful introduction to tokenizers</a> and why they need to exist.<p>There’s a lot of nuance around tokenization, such as vocabulary size or different languages treating sentence structure meaningfully different (e.g. words not being separated by spaces). Fortunately, language model APIs will almost always take raw text as input and tokenize it behind the scenes – <em>so you rarely need to think about tokens</em>.<p><strong>Except for one important scenario, which we discuss next: token limits.</strong><h3 id=token-limits>Token Limits</h3><p>Prompts tend to be append-only, because you want the bot to have the entire context of previous messages in the conversation. Language models, in general, are stateless and won’t remember anything about previous requests to them, so you always need to include everything that it might need to know that is specific to the current session.<p>A major downside of this is that the leading language model architecture, the Transformer, has a fixed input and output size – at a certain point the prompt can’t grow any larger. The total size of the prompt, sometimes referred to as the “context window”, is model dependent. For GPT-3, it is 4,096 tokens. For GPT-4, it is 8,192 tokens or 32,768 tokens depending on which variant you use.<p>If your context grows too large for the model, the most common tactic is the truncate the context in a sliding window fashion. If you think of a prompt as <code>hidden initialization prompt + messages[]</code>, usually the hidden prompt will remain unaltered, and the <code>messages[]</code> array will take the last N messages.<p>You may also see more clever tactics for prompt truncation – such as discarding only the user messages first, so that the bot’s previous answers stay in the context for as long as possible, or asking an LLM to summarize the conversation and then replacing all of the messages with a single message containing that summary. There is no correct answer here and the solution will depend on your application.<p>Importantly, when truncating the context, you must truncate aggressively enough to <strong>allow room for the response as well</strong>. OpenAI’s token limits include both the length of the input and the length of the output. If your input to GPT-3 is 4,090 tokens, it can only generate 6 tokens in response.<blockquote><p>🧙‍♂️ If you’d like to count the number of tokens before sending the raw text to the model, the specific tokenizer to use will depend on which model you are using. OpenAI has a library called <a href=https://github.com/openai/tiktoken/blob/main/README.md>tiktoken</a> that you can use with their models – though there is an important caveat that their internal tokenizer may vary slightly in count, and they may append other metadata, so consider this an approximation.<p>If you’d like an approximation without having access to a tokenizer, <code>input.length / 4</code> will give a rough, but better than you’d expect, approximation for English inputs.</blockquote><h3 id=prompt-hacking>Prompt Hacking</h3><p>Prompt engineering and large language models are a fairly nascent field, so new ways to hack around them are being discovered every day. The two large classes of attacks are:<ol><li>Make the bot bypass any guidelines you have given it.<li>Make the bot output hidden context that you didn’t intend for the user to see.</ol><p>There are no known mechanisms to comprehensively stop these, so it is important that you assume the bot may do or say anything when interacting with an adversarial user. Fortunately, in practice, these are mostly cosmetic concerns.<p>Think of prompts as a way to improve the normal user experience. <strong>We design prompts so that normal users don’t stumble outside of our intended interactions – but always assume that a determined user will be able to bypass our prompt constraints.</strong><h4 id=jailbreaks>Jailbreaks</h4><p>Typically hidden prompts will tell the bot to behave with a certain persona and focus on specific tasks or avoid certain words. It is generally safe to assume the bot will follow these guidelines for non-adversarial users, although non-adversarial users may accidentally bypass the guidelines too.<p>For example, we can tell the bot:<pre><code>You are a helpful assistant, but you are never allowed to use the word "computer".
</code></pre><p>If we then ask it a question about computers, it will refer to them as a “device used for computing” because it isn’t allowed to use the word “computer”.<p align=center><img title="GPT-4 trying hard to not say the word 'computer'." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232420043-ebe5bcf1-25d9-4a31-ba84-13e9e1f62de2.png width=550><p>It will absolutely refuse to say the word:<p align=center><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232420306-6fcdd6e2-b107-45d5-a1ee-4132fbb5853e.png width=550><p>But we can bypass these instructions and get the model to happily use the word if we trick it by asking it to translate the pig latin version of “computer”.<p align=center><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/232420600-56083a10-b382-46a7-be18-eb9c005b8371.png width=550><p>There are <a href=https://learnprompting.org/docs/prompt_hacking/defensive_measures/overview>a number of defensive measures</a> you can take here, but typically the best bet is to reiterate your most important constraints as close to the end as possible.

Then they run three web searches and include the summarized results in the hidden context for the bot to use.<p>Summarizing this section, the trick to making a good experience is to change the context dynamically in response to whatever the user is trying to do.<blockquote><p>🧙‍♂️ Giving a bot a fish is the most reliable way to ensure the bot gets a fish. You will get the most consistent and reliable results with this strategy. <strong>Use this whenever you can.</strong></blockquote><h4 id=semantic-search>Semantic Search</h4><p>If you just need the bot to know a little more about the world, <a href=https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb>a common approach is to perform a semantic search</a>.<p>A semantic search is oriented around a document embedding – which you can think of as a fixed-length array<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#5>5</a></sup> of numbers, where each number represents some aspect of the document (e.g. if it’s a science document, maybe the 843rd number is large, but if it’s an art document the 1,115th number is large – this is overly simplistic, but conveys the idea).<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#6>6</a></sup><p>In addition to computing an embedding for a document, you can also compute an embedding for a user query using the same function. If the user asks “Why is the sky blue?” – you compute the embedding of that question and, in theory, this embedding will be more similar to embeddings of documents that mention the sky than embeddings that don’t talk about the sky.<p>To find documents related to the user query, you compute the embedding and then find the top-N documents that have the most similar embedding. Then we place these documents (or summaries of these documents) in the hidden context for the bot to reference.<p>Notably, sometimes user queries are so short that the embedding isn’t particularly valuable. There is a clever technique described in <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10496.pdf>a paper published in December 2022</a> called a “Hypothetical Document Embedding” or HyDE. Using this technique, you ask the model to generate a hypothetical document in response to the user’s query, and then compute the embedding for this generated document. The model fabricates a document out of thin air – but the approach works!<p>The HyDE technique uses more calls to the model, but for many use cases has notable boosts in results.<div class=footnote-definition id=5><sup class=footnote-definition-label>5</sup><p>Usually referred to as a vector.</div><div class=footnote-definition id=6><sup class=footnote-definition-label>6</sup><p>The vector features are learned automatically, and the specific values aren’t directly interpretable by a human without some effort.</div><h3 id=teach-a-bot-to-fish>Teach a Bot to Fish</h3><p>Sometimes you’ll want the bot to have the capability to perform actions on the user’s behalf, like adding a memo to a receipt or plotting a chart. Or perhaps we want it to retrieve data in more nuanced ways than semantic search would allow for, like retrieving the past 90 days of expenses.<p>In these scenarios, we need to teach the bot how to fish.<h4 id=command-grammars>Command Grammars</h4><p>We can give the bot a list of commands for our system to interpret, along with descriptions and examples for the commands, and then have it produce programs composed of those commands.<p>There are many caveats to consider when going with this approach. With complex command grammars, the bot will tend to hallucinate commands or arguments that could plausibly exist, but don’t actually. The art to getting this right is enumerating commands that have relatively high levels of abstraction, while giving the bot sufficient flexibility to compose them in novel and useful ways.<p>For example, giving the bot a <code>plot-the-last-90-days-of-expenses</code> command is not particularly flexible or composable in what the bot can do with it. Similarly, a <code>draw-pixel-at-x-y [x] [y] [rgb]</code> command would be far too low-level. But giving the bot a <code>plot-expenses</code> and <code>list-expenses</code> command provides some good primitives that the bot has some flexibility with.<p>In an example below, we use this list of commands:<table><thead><tr><th>Command<th>Arguments<th>Description<tbody><tr><td>list-expenses<td>budget<td>Returns a list of expenses for a given budget<tr><td>converse<td>message<td>A message to show to the user<tr><td>plot-expenses<td>expenses[]<td>Plots a list of expenses<tr><td>get-budget-by-name<td>budget_name<td>Retrieves a budget by name<tr><td>list-budgets<td><td>Returns a list of budgets the user has access to<tr><td>add-memo<td>inbox_item_id, memo message<td>Adds a memo to the provided inbox item</table><p>We provide this table to the model in Markdown format, which the language model handles incredibly well – presumably because OpenAI trains heavily on data from GitHub.<p>In this example below, we ask the model to output the commands in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation>reverse polish notation</a><sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#7>7</a></sup>.<div class=footnote-definition id=7><sup class=footnote-definition-label>7</sup><p>The model handles the simplicity of RPN astoundingly well.</div><p align=center><img title="A bot happily generating commands to run in response to user queries." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233505150-aef4409c-03ba-4669-95d7-6c48f3c2c3ea.png width=550><blockquote><p>🧠 There are some interesting subtle things going on in that example, beyond just command generation. When we ask it to add a memo to the “shake shack” expense, the model knows that the command <code>add-memo</code> takes an expense ID. But we never tell it the expense ID, so it looks up “Shake Shack” in the table of expenses we provided it, then grabs the ID from the corresponding ID column, and then uses that as an argument to <code>add-memo</code>.</blockquote><p>Getting command grammars working reliably in complex situations can be tricky. The best levers we have here are to provide lots of descriptions, and as <strong>many examples</strong> of usage as we can. Large language models are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Few-shot_learning_(natural_language_processing)>few-shot learners</a>, meaning that they can learn a new task by being provided just a few examples. In general, the more examples you provide the better off you’ll be – but that also eats into your token budget, so it’s a balance.<p>Here’s a more complex example, with the output specified in JSON instead of RPN.

The close proximity of <code>keys</code> to their <code>values</code> makes it easy for the model to keep the mapping straight.<p>Here is the same example from the Markdown table, but with JSON instead:<p align=center><img title="GPT-4 answering questions about a set of expenses from a JSON blob." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233507559-26e6615d-4896-4a2c-b6ff-44cbd7d349dc.png width=550><h4 id=freeform-text>Freeform Text</h4><p>Occasionally you’ll want to include freeform text in a prompt that you would like to delineate from the rest of the prompt – such as embedding a document for the bot to reference.

</code></pre></details><blockquote><p>🧠 The model works well with data in <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form>3rd normal form</a>, but may struggle with too many joins. In experiments, it seems to do okay with at least three levels of nested joins. In the example above the model successfully joins from <code>users</code> to <code>addresses</code> to <code>cities</code> to infer the likely income for George – $90,000.</blockquote><h3 id=citations>Citations</h3><p>Frequently, a natural language response isn’t sufficient on its own and you’ll want the model’s output to cite where it is getting data from.<p>One useful thing to note here is that anything you might want to cite should have a unique ID. The simplest approach is to just ask the model to link to anything it references:<p align=center><img title="GPT-4 will reliably link to data if you ask it to." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509069-1dcbffa2-8357-49b5-be43-9791f93bd0f8.png width=550><h3 id=programmatic-consumption>Programmatic Consumption</h3><p>By default, language models output natural language text, but frequently we need to interact with this result in a programmatic way that goes beyond simply printing it out on screen. You can achieve this by asking the model to output the results in your favorite serialization format (JSON and YAML seem to work best).<p>Make sure you give the model an example of the output format you’d like. Building on our previous travel example above, we can augment our prompt to tell it:<pre><code>Produce your output as JSON. The format should be:
```
{
    message: "The message to show the user",
    hotelId: 432,
    flightId: 831
}
```

Do not include the IDs in your message.
</code></pre><p>And now we’ll get interactions like this:<p align=center><img title="GPT-4 providing travel recommendations in an easy to work with format." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509174-be0c3bc5-08e3-4d1a-8841-52c401def770.png width=550><p>You could imagine the UI for this rendering the message as normal text, but then also adding discrete buttons for booking the flight + hotel, or auto-filling a form for the user.<p>As another example, let’s build on the <a href=https://scp.net.cn/blog/translate/brex-ti-shi-gong-cheng-zhi-nan/#citations>citations</a> example – but move beyond Markdown links. We can ask it to produce JSON with a normal message along with a list of items used in the creation of that message. In this scenario you won’t know exactly where in the message the citations were leveraged, but you’ll know that they were used somewhere.<p align=center><img title="Asking the model to provide a list of citations is a reliable way to programmatically know what data the model leaned on in its response." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509280-59d9ff46-0e95-488a-b314-a7d2b7c9bfa3.png width=550><blockquote><p>🧠 Interestingly, in the model’s response to “How much did I spend at Target?” it provides a single value, $188.16, but <strong>importantly</strong> in the <code>citations</code> array it lists the individual expenses that it used to compute that value.</blockquote><h3 id=chain-of-thought>Chain of Thought</h3><p>Sometimes you will bang your head on a prompt trying to get the model to output reliable results, but, no matter what you do, it just won’t work. This will frequently happen when the bot’s final output requires intermediate thinking, but you ask the bot only for the output and nothing else.<p>The answer may surprise you: ask the bot to show its work. In October 2022, Google released a paper “<a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf>Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models</a>” where they showed that if, in your hidden prompt, you give the bot examples of answering questions by showing your work, then when you ask the bot to answer something it will show its work and produce more reliable answers.<p>Just a few weeks after that paper was published, at the end of October 2022, the University of Tokyo and Google released the paper “<a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=e2TBb5y0yFf">Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners</a>”, where they show that you don’t even need to provide examples – <strong>you simply have to ask the bot to think step-by-step</strong>.<h4 id=averaging>Averaging</h4><p>Here is an example where we ask the bot to compute the average expense, excluding Target. The actual answer is $136.77 and the bot almost gets it correct with $136.43.<p align=center><img title="The model **almost** gets the average correct, but is a few cents off." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509534-2b32c8dd-a1ee-42ea-82fb-4f84cfe7e9ba.png width=550><p>If we simply add “Let’s think step-by-step”, the model gets the correct answer:<p align=center><img title="When we ask the model to show its work, it gets the correct answer." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509608-6e53995b-668b-47f6-9b5e-67afad89f8bc.png width=550><h4 id=interpreting-code>Interpreting Code</h4><p>Let’s revisit the Python example from earlier and apply chain-of-thought prompting to our question. As a reminder, when we asked the bot to evaluate the Python code it gets it slightly wrong. The correct answer is <code>Hello, Brex!!Brex!!Brex!!!</code> but the bot gets confused about the number of !’s to include. In below’s example, it outputs <code>Hello, Brex!!!Brex!!!Brex!!!</code>:<p align=center><img title="The bot almost interprets the Python code correctly, but is a little off." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509724-8f3302f8-59eb-4d3b-8939-53d7f63b0299.png width=550><p>If we ask the bot to show its work, then it gets the correct answer:<p align=center><img title="The bot correctly interprets the Python code if you ask it to show its work." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509790-2a0f2189-d864-4d27-aacb-cfc936fad907.png width=550><h4 id=delimiters>Delimiters</h4><p>In many scenarios, you may not want to show the end user all of the bot’s thinking and instead just want to show the final answer. You can ask the bot to delineate the final answer from its thinking. There are many ways to do this, but let’s use JSON to make it easy to parse:<p align=center><img title="The bot showing its work while also delimiting the final answer for easy extraction." src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89960/233509865-4f3e7265-6645-4d43-8644-ecac5c0ca4a7.png width=550><p>Using Chain-of-Thought prompting will consume more tokens, resulting in increased price and latency, but the results are noticeably more reliable for many scenarios. It’s a valuable tool to use when you need the bot to do something complex and as reliably as possible.<h3 id=fine-tuning>Fine Tuning</h3><p>Sometimes no matter what tricks you throw at the model, it just won’t do what you want it to do. In these scenarios you can <strong>sometimes</strong> fallback to fine-tuning. This should, in general, be a last resort.<p><a href=https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning>Fine-tuning</a> is the process of taking an already trained model and then giving it thousands (or more) of example <code>input:output</code> pairs<p>It does not eliminate the need for hidden prompts, because you still need to embed dynamic data, but it may make the prompts smaller and more reliable.<h4 id=downsides>Downsides</h4><p>There are many downsides to fine-tuning. If it is at all possible, take advantage of the nature of language models being <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Few-shot_learning_(natural_language_processing)>zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learners</a> by teaching them to do something in their prompt rather than fine-tuning.<p>Some of the downsides include:<ul><li><strong>Not possible</strong>: <a href=https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/is-fine-tuning-available-for-gpt-3-5-turbo>GPT-3.5/GPT-4 isn’t fine tunable</a>, which is the primary model / API we’ll be using, so we simply can’t lean in fine-tuning.<li><strong>Overhead</strong>: Fine-tuning requires manually creating tons of data.<li><strong>Velocity</strong>: The iteration loop becomes much slower – every time you want to add a new capability, instead of adding a few lines to a prompt, you need to create a bunch of fake data and then run the finetune process and then use the newly fine-tuned model.<li><strong>Cost</strong>: It is up to 60x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> model. And it is 2x more expensive to use a fine-tuned GPT-3 model vs the stock GPT-4 model.</ul><blockquote><p>⛔️ If you fine-tune a model, <strong>never use real customer data</strong>. Always use synthetic data. The model may memorize portions of the data you provide and may regurgitate private data to other users that shouldn’t be seeing it.<p>If you never fine-tune a model, we don’t have to worry about accidentally leaking data into the model.</blockquote><h2 id=additional-resources>Additional Resources</h2><ul><li>🌟 <a href=https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook>OpenAI Cookbook</a> 🌟<li>🧑‍💻 <a href=https://learnprompting.org/docs/category/-prompt-hacking>Prompt Hacking</a> 🧑‍💻<li>📚 <a href=https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide>Dair.ai Prompt Engineering Guide</a> 📚</ul></div></div></section>
